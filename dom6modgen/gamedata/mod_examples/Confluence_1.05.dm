Those who seek to ascend must first prove their devotion by casting themselves into the fiery depths of the volcano. If found worthy by the spirit which dwells within, they emerge from the fiery lake reborn as Pyroclastic Spirits, beings wreathed in swirling ash, molten rock, and embers. These reborn beings are bound in eternal servitude to the will of Mount Ignarius, and are in turn granted powers beyond mortal comprehension. They are capable of summoning torrents of lava, conjuring volcanic eruptions, and shaping the magma beneath the earth, bending it to their will."

	#descr "The Abysians are a race of molten humanoids born from the cataclysmic destruction of the besieged city of Edranor. During the ill-fated ascension ritual, unleashed arcane forces triggered a devastating volcanic eruption which consumed both the city’s inhabitants and the surrounding forces. From the ashes and molten rock, strange, magmatic beings emerged, forged in the crucible of destruction and bound by the lingering magic of the failed ritual. 
These beings radiate furnace-like heat, their veins coursing with molten rock, and their skin perpetually glowing with cracks of smoldering embers. Impervious to all forms of fire, they thrive in the harshest infernos but are deeply vulnerable to cold, which saps their strength and dims their fiery essence. Winter’s chill is particularly perilous, causing their molten cores to harden and their spirits to falter.
Abysians march to war in heavy iron armor, tempered to endure their searing touch, wielding massive weapons designed for crushing rather than finesse. On the battlefield, they are relentless, their fiery aura burning away vegetation, heating metal, and unnerving their enemies. Despite their destructive nature, Abysians are not wholly devoid of humanity, and fragments of their former lives still linger in their fiery hearts."

#name "Burning One"
#descr "The first Abysians were hellish but majestic beings, their forms blazing with mesmerizing intensity. But with each passing generation, the fiery essence that defines their kind has begun to fade. The once-blazing cores of the Abysians now burn a little cooler, their molten veins flowing a little slower. Their bodies, once a brilliant cascade of liquid flame, are now dulled and smoldering, their inner fire dwindling like dying embers.

#newmonster 16935 -- HEAT 3
#name "Blazing One" -- trained as priests or warriors
#descr "Among the Abysians, not all were created equal. The fiery cataclysm that gave rise to their kind was far from uniform. Those ordinary humans of Musafir engulfed by the destruction became lesser molten humanoids, yet, those who had wielded great magical power in life - the mages of Edranor - emerged as something greater.
Blazing Ones stand as a testament to this disparity. These Abysians descend from a lineage marked by immense magical potential, their molten forms still pulsing with the arcane power of the cataclysm. Nearly as fierce and radiant as those first Abysians, Blazing Ones burn with a fiery intensity that sets them apart from their kin. Their cores glow with the brilliance of molten suns, and flames constantly dance along their obsidian-like skin. While Abysians grow dimmer with each generation, their fiery essence fading like the cooling remains of a forge, Blazing Ones are more resistant to this decline, though not entirely immune. Their inherited magic keeps their flames nearly as vibrant and ferocious as those of the first Abysians.
The existence of Abysians of prominent heritage fuels a subtle hierarchy within Abysian society as these descendants are often held in higher regard than those formed from ordinary humans, creating divisions that echo through Abysian culture. Some view the Blazing Ones with reverence, believing them to be the purest representation of their race's fiery heritage, while others yet see them as a reminder of the inequality inherent in their origins, sparking envy and resentment among lesser Abysians.

#descr "Pyremasters are the generals of Abysian armies, chosen from among their most experienced and capable warriors who have proved their mettle in grueling campaigns, and earned the respect of their peers. They typically come from the ranks of common Abysians, while positions of greater authority are often reserved for those of distinguished lineage.
The title of a Pyremaster originates from the Great Pyre, an immense forge and fortress at the heart of Abysian. The Pyre is a massive, smoldering stronghold where Abysian weapons and armor are forged in intense heat that only their kind can endure. It serves as the nexus of military organization, and armament production. It is here that one ascends to the position of a Pyremaster through a ceremony which symbolizes tempering of one’s resolve and authority in the forge’s crucible.
As stewards of the Pyre, Pyremasters oversee the production of arms and deployment of armies. Their title serves as a reminder that Abysian power is forged in the flames of discipline and battle."

As the flames within every Abysian slowly wane, dimming with each generation, the Warlocks have turned to Blood magic to rekindle the inner fire and preserve their kind.

#name "Anointed of Rhuax"
#descr "The first Abysians which arose in the wake of the Edranorian Cataclysm were majestic and radiant beings, their forms more akin to liquid flame than solid matter. Yet, this fiery brilliance was fleeting. With each successive generation, the magic that birthed them waned, their molten forms growing more solid and their flames dimmer. However, not all Abysians were touched equally by the cataclysm. Those who had wielded great magical power in life, particularly the mages of Edranor, emerged as something greater. These rare, exalted beings, known as Blazing Ones, retained much of their ancestors’ radiance. Marked by their heritage and power, Blazing Ones rose to positions of leadership in the nascent Abysian society, their immense size and overwhelming presence setting them apart, while their arcane might solidified their rule. It was not only their strength that earned them their divine mandate but also the reverence the lesser Abysians held for them. 
From along the line of the Blazing Ones arose the Anointed of Rhuax, the rulers of Abysia and the high priests of the Flame Cult. The Anointed have established the Order of the Anathemants to oversee the intricate rites of the Flame Cult. While lesser Abysians tend to minor offerings and maintain the temples, the Anointed themselves preside over the grand rituals of the All-Consuming Fire, and safeguard the sacred flame that sustains their people, performing rites to keep it from flickering. 
Yet beneath their rule, discontent simmers. Among the lesser Abysians, resentment grows—not only from the stark inequality between their dimming flames and the enduring brilliance of their leaders but also from the slow, inescapable fading of their inner fire, threatening their very existence."

Though the flames of Catharsis remained pure even after his fall, those who attempt to wield them risk drawing unwanted attention from the King of Banefires or the Daevas, and falling under their influence.
The Anointed of Anthrax retain much of their former power, but their flames have taken on a darker and more sickly hue, flickering with an unsettling intensity. Believing themselves to be instruments of a ‘purer’ renewal, they seek to upend the established order of the Flame Cult, claiming the current practices are inadequate to sustain the dwindling Abysian race."

#descr "The Phoenix is a smaller, less powerful cousin of the legendary Firebird, yet still a formidable creature in its own right, similarly composed of vibrant flames that flicker and shift with every beat of its wings. Immortal in nature, it possesses the ability to regenerate from its ashes if slain. Radiating intense heat, it can ignite anything it touches, and its fiery feathers are said to burn with magical properties and are often sought out by alchemists and enchanters. While it may not possess the godlike invincibility of the Firebird, the Phoenix still strikes fear into those who witness its blazing form, as its presence often signals destruction. Terrified of water, the Phoenix avoids lakes and rivers, instinctively fleeing from anything that threatens to extinguish its flames. Though far less imposing than the Firebird, the Phoenix remains a dangerous force of nature, driven by the raw magic of fire."

#name "All-Consuming Flame"
#descr "The Abysian religion centers around the Flame Cult and the worship of the All-Consuming Flame, an eternal and unquenchable fire destined to consume the world and see it remade. Within Abysian dominion, all fires burn with heightened intensity, and some even spring to life, attacking and incinerating those deemed heretics by the One True Flame. As the influence of the All-Consuming Flame spreads, it will ultimately engulf all lands, cleansing and rebirthing the world in its purifying fires."
#details "Enables the 'Open Gates of Rhuax' ritual spell in the capital. 
Grants +3 Fire gems per turn and +1 for every province with friendly dominion.
Fire Elementals will attack enemy commanders in lands with Abysian dominion and Heat scales.
The chance for enemy commanders to get attacked is equal to Abysian dominion x 10 %.

Heat 1 = size 2 Fire Elemental
Heat 2 = size 3 Fire Elemental
Heat 3 = size 4 Fire Elemental
Heat 4 = size 5 Fire Elemental
Heat 5 = size 6 Fire Elemental

For each Heat scale present there will be an additional dominion power x10% chance to get assassinated by a size 2 Fire Elemental. In Heat 5 - assuming Abysian dominion is present - there will be 5 additional assassination rolls."

Abysians imbued with the power of this ritual will find their flames renewed and burning brightly, like those of the first Abysians, the Children of Rhuax. However, stoking the fires that flow within all Abysians does not come without a heavy price for a flame that burns twice as bright, burns half as long. Abysians recruited under the Burning Vengeance will find themselves surrounded by fierce fires once again, and will burst into violent flames upon death, however, the power needed to rekindle their former fire can only be drawn from their own inner-Flame which will burn away even faster."
--details "All newly recruited national units will receive deathfire - explosion on death - with an area of effect of 2.5 per point of size - rounded down, and a Fire Shield with a flat value of 6, or +2 Fire Shield on units with an already existing Fire Shield trait.

#name "Ring of Power"
#descr "Long ago, in the shadow of Mount Ignarius, an ascension ritual meant to save a doomed, besieged city went awry. A desperate communion of mages attempted to transcend into a higher plane of existence to escape their fate. But the ritual spiraled beyond control, causing the dormant volcano to erupt, consuming both the city and the besieging army in a fiery cataclysm. In one apocalyptic moment, the city was reduced to ruin, with everyone either incinerated or transformed into magmatic beings now known as Abysians. Amidst this devastation, the spirit of the volcano awakened.
The origin of the volcanic spirit remains a mystery. Some believe it was forged from the immense power unleashed during the disaster, while others claim it simply roused from its slumber, awakened by the magnitude of the event. But there are those who speculate that the archmage who initiated the ascension ritual did not die, but was instead consumed and transformed, becoming an immortal volcanic entity known as the spirit of the volcano. 
Forged in the molten depths of Mount Ignarius, the Ring of Power is infused with the power of the volcano itself. Crafted from cooled lava and imbued with the essence of fire, the ring radiates the searing heat of Mount Ignarius and grants its bearer dominion over fire. Those who wield it can conjure massive spheres of molten lava and hurl them upon their foes. On impact, these fiery orbs erupt in a violent explosion of flames, from which fire elementals spring forth, ready to obey the ring bearer’s will.
Those who possess the ring come to fall under its lure. The ring acts as a conduit to the ancient volcanic spirit whose presence seeps into the mind of anyone who wields it. Over time, the bearer will feel the relentless pull of the volcano, an insidious call drawing them toward the fiery heart from which the spirit was born. Those who hold the ring for too long are eventually consumed by this desire, drawn into the depths of Mount Ignarius, never to return."

Its massive, fiery form blazes with an intense heat, and it soars through the skies, leaving a trail of embers in its wake. The Firebird cannot be killed by any mortal means. When slayed, it erupts in a cataclysmic burst of flames, reducing itself and anyone nearby to ash. From these ashes, the creature will rise again, renewed and more powerful.
Composed entirely of fire, the Firebird’s radiant body flickers and dances like a living inferno. Despite its awe-inspiring nature, the Firebird harbors a deep-seated terror of water. The mere presence of it sends it into a frenzy of terror, as water represents the one force capable of momentarily dampening its power. Yet, even this reprieve is brief, for the Firebird’s flames will eventually reignite, and it will return to exact vengeance on those who dared to challenge its immortal fury.

The Firebird will cast Phoenix Pyre at the start of the battle."

As the failed ascension ritual unleashed a torrent of chaotic magic, igniting the volcano and annihilating the great city of Edranor and the vast besieging forces, the Ignis Circle materialized from the raw, untamed energy, drawn to the eruption, feeding on the primal forces unleashed.
The entity communicates with Abysians through the crackling of embers and the roar of volcanic eruptions, whispering secrets of forgotten magic and ancient knowledge. To them, it is a reminder that they, too, are part of the eternal cycle of destruction and rebirth."

#name "Molten Sphere"
#descr "The Molten Sphere is a god-like entity which appears as an immense orb of molten lava, swirling with inner currents of red-hot magma and pulsing with a slow, rhythmic power like the heartbeat of an ancient star. The Sphere drifts above volcanic craters and fields of obsidian, exuding an intense, otherworldly heat. As it hovers, molten droplets fall from its core, birthing fire elementals in its wake. According to legend, the Molten Sphere was once a mortal spirit of profound magic, cast into an endless inferno by a coven of rival sorcerers. Rather than being destroyed, this sorcerer fused with the fires, absorbing their energy until he transcended his human form. In time, he became an immortal being of magma and flame, shedding all traces of his past humanity and rising as the Molten Sphere—a living embodiment of fiery wrath and boundless creation. 
To the Abysians, the Sphere is a divine entity and a kindred spirit which reminds them that they, too, were woven from destructive flames and magic."

#name "Abysia Reborn"
#epithet "Children of Flame"
#era 1
#brief "Abysians are lava-born humanoids that radiate heat. Abysians mainly use heavy infantry. They have skilled Fire and Blood mages and their priests can perform blood sacrifices. Abysians dislike cold provinces."
#descr "In the final hours of the siege of the great city of Edranor – driven by desperation – the Edranorians attempted a mass ascension ritual that would elevate them beyond the realm of mortality. In their madness, they overreached and sealed their own fate. The ritual they attempted was a reckless endeavor, doomed to fail—one that required an impossible control over the vast amount of Arcana being channeled. Blinded by their desperation, they pushed forward, even as the forces they unleashed spiraled out of their grasp. The earth trembled beneath them as the ritual unraveled. Fissures opened, splitting the ground as raw Arcana surged through the land. A slumbering volcano, agitated by the rumbling earth and the immense power being drawn upon, violently erupted, spewing molten rock and fire. The great city of Edranor, along with much of the invading force, was consumed in an instant, swallowed by the earth and obliterated by the cascading eruption and violent discharge of Arcana. Ash and fire billowed forth, blanketing the land, reducing the once-great city to ruins. But from the ruins of the destroyed city, something new arose. The failed ascension gave birth to the Abysians, a race of molten beings forged in the crucible of Edranor's destruction.
The land still bears the scars of the disaster. The heart of the devastation is a charred wasteland where rivers of molten rock carve through the barren landscape and the air shimmers with heat. Obsidian fields stretch across the land, reflecting the molten glow of the great volcano that still looms at the center, its lava-lit caverns now a home for the Abysians."
#summary "Race: Humanoids. Radiate heat and prefers Heat scales. Wasteland survival. Death/Growth scales have halved effect on income and population growth, and no effect on supplies.
Military: Heavy infantry, no missile weapons, salamander cavalry. Unit recruitment requires Heat 1 scales or higher. 
Magic: Fire, Blood, Astral, some Earth.
Priests: Powerful, can perform blood sacrifices.
Dominion: Spreads Heat (max 3).
Forts negate Heat scale deaths. Other lands suffer 0.2% and 0.4% less in Heat 4/5."

#descr "Through this process four distinct gemstone automata - ruby, diamond, quartz, and sapphire - are merged into a single, powerful centurion automaton. Each gemstone automaton possesses its own unique abilities which are combined within the centurion. The process of Vertical Integration involves binding the core essences of these automata into a single, unified entity. If performed successfully, the result is a towering Centurion automaton, far superior to the sum of its parts."
#details "Kills a Ruby, Diamond, Sapphire, and Quartz Automaton to create a Centurion. For the spell to work at least one of each automaton type must be present in the province. This enchantment will only have effect once per month per province regardless of the number of units present."

Once critically damaged, their ruby core will ignite and trigger an explosion, unleashing a fiery blast that incinerates or severely burns nearby enemies.

The heat produced by the ruby-powered cores is so intense that these automata are even capable of release a single, powerful breath of fire upon those located nearby. The Ruby Automata will continue to function until the magical energies stored within the gemstones that power them are depleted."

To manage this, Clockwork Conveyors - robust mechanical units designed for transporting resources - are used to tirelessly move surplus resources between clockwork facilities. Driven by an intricate system of gears and powered by arcane energy, these conveyors ensure a steady flow of materials, optimizing production and preventing bottlenecks in the supply chain.

The Clockwork Conveyor doesn’t require any commander points to recruit, however to ensure it is built always place them in the recruitment queue first, before any other commander purchases which use up commander points. If there are no commander points available left over in the recruitment queue, they will not be produced despite costing no commander points."

Engineered to streamline the creation process, these automata are integral in advancing the Master Makers' experiments, particularly in their quest to create ever more sophisticated automata and, ultimately, true artificial life.
Powered by springs and guided by the arcane knowledge of their creators, the delicate mechanisms of these automata allow them to forge the necessary items with more efficiency than any mage-smith, thus requiring fewer magic gems during the forging process.
Though limited to the specific task of forging, these automata perform their duties with mechanical precision, easing the burden on the Master Makers and allowing them to focus more on experimentation and innovation. Their specialized role has been essential in the grand design of the citadel’s automaton army and the expansion of arcane machinery throughout the stronghold.

Forge-bots can be further enhanced and their efficiency increased greatly by adding forgable upgrades which can be inserted into the machine's core."

The Resource-bots are integral to the expansion of the Master Makers' clockwork armies. These automata work ceaselessly, boosting resource output by extracting and refining raw materials at an accelerated rate, which in turn speeds up the construction of additional clockwork creations. Their meticulous efficiency ensures that more complex and resource-heavy automata can be created faster, thus allowing the Master Makers to replenish and enhance their mechanical forces in times of need.
In periods of extreme urgency, the Resource-bots can push their operational limits, increasing their output fivefold. However, this drastic boost comes at a considerable risk, as the immense strain placed on their mechanical frames makes them prone to malfunction or complete destruction with each passing month of overwork. 

Resource-bots can be further enhanced and their production greatly increased by adding forgable upgrades which can be inserted into the machine's core. By changing shape, the Resource-bot can produce vastly more resources, but at considerable risk of destruction each passing month."

#name "Ruby Spider Automaton"
#descr "The Ruby Spider Automata draw power from magically imbued rubies which contain pure elemental Fire magic. These automata are vastly more complex and difficult to create than other types of spiderling automata, but are often also quite more deadly and destructive. They are often used as skirmishers and are typically deployed as a first wave. Ruby Spider Automata are not expected to last throughout any battle, and indeed, that is part of their design. Once critically damaged, their ruby core will ignite and trigger an explosion, unleashing a fiery blast that incinerates or severely burns nearby enemies. 
Unlike other automata, the spiderlings are much more fragile and easier to destroy, though they are also far easier to create, and don't require much maintenance and upkeep."

#descr "A highly sophisticated construct designed to sustain and empower nearby automata during battle. The Arcane Battery acts as a mobile reservoir of magical energy, continuously radiating power to any automaton within its range. Arcane currents will flow out of the battery, feeding directly into the gemstone cores of the automata. This allows them to fight tirelessly, negating the risk of running out of magic during prolonged engagements. As long as the Arcane Battery remains active, automata can maintain full combat effectiveness. The battery itself, while robust, is immensely sensitive and vulnerable to magic and requires careful placement and defense. If destroyed, nearby automata immediately begin to drain their internal reserves, leaving them vulnerable to deactivation.  "

Suspended mid-air, this towering orb hums with silent, latent power, its intricate mechanisms ever in motion. Gleaming gears and arcane-infused cogs constantly rotate, generating an invisible field that senses and suppresses magic in its vicinity.
The Null-Magic Sphere is no ordinary construct; it is a masterwork of arcane engineering, detecting even the faintest trace of spellwork and unraveling it before it can be fully cast. While minor spells might slip through its influence, any complex or powerful magic is immediately stifled, ensuring that no hostile magic can threaten the sanctity of the citadel."

-- Golem of the Stars -----------------------------------------------------------------------


#newmonster 6892
#name "Golem of the Stars" -- These oddities have left many to wonder whether the automaton god is truly mindless, or if some hidden, nascent consciousness stirs within it. Some believe that the Clockwork Deity was left incomplete, while others speculate that the Master Makers knew it was no failure at all—that in time, it may awaken to a purpose beyond their own understanding. Whether a husk of their unfulfilled ambition or a dormant god yet to rise, the Clockwork Deity remains a source reverence.
#spr1 "./Confluence/EA_Antikythera/AtlasMachine1.tga"
#spr2 "./Confluence/EA_Antikythera/AtlasMachine1.tga"
#descr "The Golem of the Stars is the very last creation of the Master Makers before their citadel vanished as mysteriously as it had appeared. A towering marvel of artifice - an awe-inspiring construct of gleaming metal, gemstones, and intricate gears. Monumental in size, this automaton god was intended to be the pinnacle of their craft, a being of immense power, worshipped by the faithful and powered by their prayers. Yet, despite its grandeur, it is yet another failure, evidently lacking a spark of divinity or any kind of soul-like quality. Much like the countless other clockwork creations left behind, it follows its assigned tasks without deviation or true understanding. However, every once in a while, this mindless automaton will behave erratically and unpredictably, a brief hesitation before delivering judgment, a flicker of movement from its cold, gemstone eyes, or a cryptic gesture."

#name "The Iron Divine"
#spr1 "./Confluence/EA_Antikythera/MechGod1.tga"
#spr2 "./Confluence/EA_Antikythera/MechGod1.tga"
#descr "The Iron Divine stands as one of the most ancient attempts to forge an artificial god by the Master Makers. This imposing automaton, a relic of ancient ingenuity, draws its strength not from arcane energy or gemstone-powered cores, but from fervent prayers and devotion of those who revere it.
Crafted in the image of divine entities, the Iron Divine's metallic form radiates an awe-inspiring aura, its surface etched with intricate patterns of faith and belief. Its power is directly tied to the number of faithful. In lands where its worshipers are numerous, the Iron Divine stands as an unstoppable force, imbued with nearly limitless power. However, in distant lands where belief in it has waned, its might diminishes, leaving it a mere husk of its former glory.
Though the people of Antikythera are aware that the Iron Divine is no real god, they still see it as a guardian of its people and their silent prayers have kept its gear grinding for centuries, a mechanical deity powered by the very essence of belief itself, ready to defend and inspire its followers with the might of their devotion."

The artifact is capable of exploring countless combinations of materials, elemental catalysts, and magic weaves far beyond the capacity of any mortal mind.
The Master Makers consult the Athenaeum like an oracle, seeking its guidance on the next step in their pursuit of sentient creations.

At its core, the Master Forge is a marvel of innovation. It can weave together the most exotic materials, fusing them with magical energies in ways no mortal hand could achieve. Where the Master Athenaeum can devise new concepts and designs, the Master Forge can put them to the test and help create them. Within its heart, impossibly fine hammers strike metal infused with magic, shaping the most complex and delicate components imaginable. Rotating chambers, each dedicated to different arcane processes, test the limits of material strength and magical conductivity. Endlessly refining and perfecting designs, the Master Forge is responsible for producing the parts and artifacts required for their most advanced Antikytheran constructs. Though a marvel in its own right, the Master Forge is more than a tool; it is an extension of the Master Makers’ pursuit of perfection. It adapts and evolves, incorporating new discoveries into its designs, constantly pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved through mechanical and magical synthesis."

#descr "The Master Artifact is a titanic creation of the Master Makers, designed to produce the immense resources necessary for their complex and ambitious constructs. A vast, self-sustaining engine of arcane and mechanical wonder, it stands at the heart of their citadel, endlessly converting raw elements into rare and valuable materials.  
The Artifact operates through the manipulation of fundamental forces, breaking down raw elements and transmuting them into refined materials of unparalleled purity. At its core lies a vast matrix of conduits, arcane generators, and alchemical chambers, each dedicated to transforming base substances into rare alloys, enchanted gems, and magical essences. The machine is capable of extracting and refining resources from nearly anything—be it raw ore, broken remnants of ancient relics, or even the ambient magic of the world. Earth may be turned into metal, air may be harnessed and refined into energy, and even the raw essence of magic distilled and stored in reservoirs for future use.
Its chambers echo with the sound of constant alchemy and transformation, and the grinding of colossal gears as elements shift and combine within its labyrinthine mechanisms. While it does not possess the same oracular wisdom as the Master Athenaeum, or the craftsmanship of the Master Forge, it is an equally important automaton to the Master Makers, for without it, their grand visions of artificial life and clockwork gods would have been mere dreams."

#selectnation 305
#name "Antikythera"
#epithet "Land of the Automata"
#era 1
#descr "In a distant and secluded valley, long forgotten by the world, an extraordinary citadel has suddenly emerged - an unassailable fortress that should surely have taken an entire lifetime to build - ambitiously reaching for the skies much to the dismay of the few native inhabitants of this isolated valley. In this impossible structure of metal and stone and shinning gemstones live the brilliant artificers now known as the Master Makers, mage-smiths of great wisdom and knowledge.
Little is known about these enigmatic figures, expect perhaps the genius that allows them to create inscrutable and marvelous metallic beings capable of performing astonishing feats, and their kindness towards the impoverished and struggling natives of the valley who are spared being pressed into any kind of service, or paying exorbitant taxes often demanded by rulers in other lands, while yet enjoying the protection of their automata none the same.
Spring-driven automata powered by precious gemstones imbued with powerful elemental magic guard the citadel of the Master Makers, and all those who now call this new realm their home. 
Colossal metallic constructs, tall as towers, stand vigil at the gates of the growing city, while automata as tiny as a street cat, and just as agile, scurry along the busy streets, skittering thisaway and thataway. High up on the parapets the ever-crackling and buzzing sound of lightning can be heard from machines that steadily hum with power, and the entire city reverberates with the ever-present sound of hammers and metallic gears tick tick ticking away."
#summary "Race: Automaton constructs. Production bonus 50% in all forts. Income penalty 25%. Mercenary penalty 25%. Capital starts with 20k population.
Military: Heavily armored automata, colossal automata, specialized automaton commanders.
Magic: Astral, Earth, Air, Water and Fire. Superior magic item forging. Research-bots not affected by Drain scales. Capital only mages.
Priests: Very weak"
#brief "Antikythera is the land of clockworks and spring driven automata, ruled by mysterious and powerful Master Makers."

#newmonster 16189
#name "Dur-Halam Warrior"
#descr "The inhabitants of the wilderness of Dur-Halam are a proud and fierce people, shaped by their untamed homeland. Their lands consist of towering mountain ranges blanketed in thick, ancient forests, where survival depends on one's ability to adapt to the untamed wild. They live off the land, honing their skills as expert woodsmen and mountaineers, able to navigate the dense forests and scale the craggy peaks with ease. Many a man boasts of knowing every tree and peak in their domain.
From a young age, the people of Dur-Halam are taught to respect the land and master its challenges. Upon reaching adulthood, each man undergoes a sacred rite of passage, choosing a weapon that will define his path as a warrior. Heavier armor is often foregone, deemed too cumbersome to carry in the rugged terrain they traverse.
These warriors live in tight-knit clans, defending their land with ferocity and upholding traditions rooted in survival, honor, but most importantly in the will of the gods as of late."

#newmonster 16193
#name "Dur-Halam Raider"
#descr "Though considered primitive barbarians by many—especially the people of Aurum, who scorn them as uncouth savages—the warriors of Dur-Halam are fierce and proud. Their vast mountain ranges are home to countless tribes, each as stubborn and unyielding as the terrain they inhabit. Before the fateful starfall, these tribes were locked in endless blood feuds and frequently carried out small raids against one another, trapped in a cycle of infighting for generations.
However, everything changed after the meteor fell. Shamans and druids interpreted the celestial event as a divine omen, prophesying the rise of a unified Dur-Halam. For the first time in history, the warring clans set aside their rivalries, rallying under a single banner with one clear purpose, the conquest of the world. No longer limited by internal strife, the tribes set up to conquer the world, driven by the will of the gods.
Dur-Halam raiders operate in small, swift parties that advance ahead of the main host. They conduct raids against poorly defended settlements, pillaging and sowing and much chaos as possible, aiming to disrupt supply lines, probe the readiness of their enemies, and soften the opposition before the main force arrives."

Known for their ability to enter a berserker rage in battle, they are said to channel the spirits of the very creatures they hunt and are particularly ferocious and dangerous warriors."

#newmonster 16196
#name "Warmaker"
#descr "When the great meteor swept across the night sky and struck Dur-Halam, fires engulfed the lands. People despaired, believing they were being punished by the gods. Yet, despite the widespread destruction the meteor had wrought, it was clear all were spared and it became obvious that they were not cursed by the gods, but rather favored. The meteor and the fire that engulfed the lands but felled no one were prophetic for they foreshadowed the flame-haired warriors of Dur-Halam would one day sweep across the world as unstoppable as the fires that once engulfed the mountain ranges they call their own. 
Among all the warriors of Dur-Halam, the Warmakers stand as the fiercest devotees to this prophecy. Flame-haired and battle-hardened, these religious fanatics see themselves as the living embodiment of Dur-Halam's destined conquest, fueled by a sacred fire that cannot be extinguished. War is their faith, and conflict their offering to the gods. Wherever they march, unrest follows, for peace is anathema to them. Like fire, they spread across the world, shattering empires, believing the world itself theirs to claim."

From this otherworldly metal, weapons of immense power were forged. Warriors from all the tribes across the entire range of Dur-Halam gathered and fought for the honor of wielding such a weapon, but only a precious few were deemed worthy. From these champions two ranks of warriors were formed, the Meteor Throwers and the Meteor Guard. 
The Meteor Guard is composed of towering, stocky warriors, armed with weapons forged from star metal. In battle they usually hold the front line, forming a shield wall with their imposing stature and great shields capable of absorbing magic. Known for their relentless dedication, the Meteor Guard spend countless hours perfecting their martial skills. Their imposing stature requires them to be outfitted with much larger armaments than that of regular troops."

The Meteor Throwers are composed out of warriors who wield massive spheres made of star metal attached to heavy chains. In battle, they spin with powerful, swift rotations, building momentum before hurling the great projectiles into enemy ranks. The weighty spheres, when flung with such force, will doubtlessly crush whomever it hits. As strength, balance, and proper timing are essential, Meteor Throwers spend remarkable amounts of time training and exercising. The Meteor Throwers' imposing stature requires them to be outfitted with much larger armaments than that of regular troops."

#newmonster 16203
#name "Shaman"
#descr "The shamans guide the tribes of Dur-Halam in spiritual matters and act as advisers to the chieftains of the tribes. However, beneath this facade lies a deeper truth, as it is the shamans who are the true guiding force within Dur-Halam society. Chieftains often rely heavily on their counsel. While they may enact policies and lead the tribe in the physical world, it is the shaman's guidance that shapes their choices. Every decision the chieftain makes is shaped by the shaman's visions and portents. Through rituals and communion with the spirits, shamans gain insights into the destiny of the tribe, ensuring that every decision aligns with a higher purpose. Their higher purpose. In reality, it is the shaman's whispered counsel that directs their path.
All shamans have some magic skills though the shamans of different tribes practice different types of magic. Some commune with the spirits of the earth, some listen to the whispers in the wind, some speak with dancing flames, while some yet look to the stars for guidance."

While the Sky Gazers are dedicated to tracking the movement of celestial objects, the Sky Watchers focus not solely on celestial phenomena but also on the flight of birds and other airborne creatures. They believe that these movements are connected to greater cosmic forces, subtle indicators of change or impending events. Their sharp eyes track the faintest disturbances, whether a flock shifting direction or an unusual flight pattern. Over time, the Sky Watchers have become remarkably adept at interpreting subtle changes. Their keen awareness and constant vigilance also allows them to perceive any potential danger long before it can reach the lands of Dur-Halam."

Among their most accomplished creations are the Meteor Hammer and the Meteor Sword. Working with the rare star metal has taught Sky Smiths to preserve precious materials and craft their armaments very efficiently, thus requiring less ore to forge them."

-- Meteor Druid --------------------------------------------------------------------------


#newmonster 16208
#name "Meteor Druid"
#descr "There is scant difference between shamans and druids and most consider them one and the same as they both deal with spiritual matters and divine the will of the gods. In reality, while the differences are perhaps subtle to the uneducated, they are profound. Shamans are simple spiritualists and mystics who commune with the various spirits of the land and hold sway over their respective tribes. The druids, on the other hand, are philosopher-priests who study astrology and the constellations and commune with the cosmos. Unlike shamans, the druids are revered by all equally for their wisdom and knowledge, and have ambitions over all the tribes.
With the coming of the meteor, the druids of Dur-Halam have donned a new mantle as the high priests of a new religion centered around the divine significance of the meteor, and acquired the means to exert influence over all of Dur-Halam. The meteor crater has become its most sacred site, drawing countless pilgrims every year to witness the place where the gods' gift fell from the heavens. In the massive crater, a grand temple now stands, tended by the Meteor Druids. Revered as the spiritual leaders of Dur-Halam, their prophecies help shape the course of the realm. 
It was the Meteor Druids who first foresaw the unification of the scattered tribes under a single banner, an act they claim was divinely ordained. Through their communion with the gods and interpretation of portends, the druids continue to foresee the future of Dur-Halam, predicting its rise to greatness. By interpreting divine omens, they subtly steer the decisions of Dur-Halam's rulers, ensuring that all actions align with the grand celestial plan they claim to decipher. Their guidance is seen as infallible, and through their deep connection with the heavens, they have become the true power behind Dur-Halam's ascent. However, their control over this new and turbulent religion has proven imperfect, as religious fervor continues to grow to dangerous heights."

#descr "It is said that Goliath was born of a giant, but orphaned at birth as his mother could not bear the strain of bringing him into the world. Even as a child, he towered over the adults of his village, his size and strength considered unnatural. Fearful of the child giant and driven by hate of everything that is different than them, the people of the village enslaved Goliath and put him to grueling manual labor. Over the long years of mistreatment, Goliath's bitterness grew and his heart hardened with a seething hatred for the folk of the village taking root inside it. 
Then came the day the great meteor fell, and the lands of Dur-Halam were set ablaze. Little is known of what transpired in the village on that faithful day, but one thing is certain; Goliath had broken free. In a vengeful rage, he slaughtered his entire village and crowned himself king over the ruins. While no longer a slave, he discarded his chains only briefly, long enough to have them reforged with the very metal from the fallen star. These chains now serve to remind him of mankind's cruelty, forever wrapped around his massive frame. Though a self-proclaimed king, Goliath commands no armies, for he despises the people of Dur-Halam as much as he does the villagers who enslaved him. He serves only the god that freed him."

#descr "Men are not the only ones who bear arms and go hunting. Women, too, take up the hunt, whether it’s for small woodland creatures or fearsome, grizzled beasts. But Glesh the Huntress is the only women who specializes in hunting far more exotic game - other humans. Her lethal efficiency has not gone unnoticed, attracting the attention - and the blessings - of the ascendant god of Dur-Halam, and earning her quite a fearsome reputation among her kin."

#descr "Performed under the gaze of a full moon, the ritual demands the offering of rare, accursed relics and the chanting of ancient incantations passed down through generations of shamans. The one chosen for the ritual is placed within a rune-etched circle surrounded by totems, where dark energies converge, binding to their soul. As the ritual reaches its peak, a shadowy aura surrounds them, seeping into their essence. From that moment, all who touch the bearer of this power will find themselves cursed, their luck turned sour. To be protected by this baleful aura is a grave burden, for while it protects, it also condemns the bearer to a life of isolation, forever shunned by those who fear the curse they carry."

#descr "Much has been gleamed by the Meteor Druids by observing and studying the movement of the stars. With this ritual, a skilled Meteor Druid can reach for the starlit sky and pull down a star from the firmaments, guiding it towards a desired location, often with devastating consequences. The falling star will shatter in countless little pieces as it nears the ground that will wreak havoc among those unfortunate enough to be caught present. Performing this ritual is no easy task as it requires both great skill and immense timing and prediction on the part of the Meteor Druid to hit a moving army."
#details "Seventy five meteors will strike any army located in the province. This attack occurs after regular movement phase and thus any army moving out of the targeted province won't be hit. All units will remain in their formations for the duration of the strike. Meteors will not randomly hit across the battlefield, but will largely strike on top of the enemy army. 

If cast on the besieged fort, the enchantment will strike the sieging army. Otherwise, it will strike the province defence and not the army within the fortification.

Furthermore, 8% of the population in the province will be killed, unrest will increase by 30, and there is a 20% chance for both the lab and temple to get destroyed."

#name "Bloodstone" 
#descr "The Bloodstone is a massive slab of dark, jagged rock, standing ominously in the heart of its sacred domain. Its surface is marred by deep, crimson veins, from which thick rivulets of blood slowly ooze, dripping onto the ground below. The blood that seeps from the Bloodstone is said to be the essence of the spirit that dwells within - an ancient entity bound to the rock since time immemorial. The Bloodstone’s power is deeply intertwined with bloodshed and conquest. Whenever its followers take new lands in the name of war, the stone responds, bleeding more profusely as a sign of its satisfaction. Each victory feeds the spirit within, intensifying the flow until the very ground around it is stained red. For the followers of the Bloodstone, this sanguine outpouring is a sacred blessing, a visceral testament to their growing dominion and the favor of the ancient force they serve.

The Bloodstone will grant 1d6 blood slaves for every non-forted newly-captured province if not awake, and 3d6 for every non-forted newly-captured province when awake."

#descr "It is said that once upon a time, the Crownless King had a brother, and that together they claimed dominion over the vast and jagged mountain ranges of Dur-Halam.

However, over time, the Crownless King grew envious of his brother’s growing recognition as the rightful ruler of the land, revered for imposing order and the rule of law while his own name was profaned. Unable to tolerate living in the shadow of his brother’s reign, he killed him to claim dominion over their shared domain and prove that might is the only true path to leadership. Thus it has remained in Dur-Halam for an era, where the tribes of Dur-Halam remained in constant wars, fighting for the right to rule.

The statue’s surface is rough, dark, and speckled with shimmering stardust that glows faintly like distant stars, hinting at its cosmic origin. The spirit within is a being of celestial origin, ancient and inscrutable, contained within the meteor’s fragments from which the statue was shaped. It is said that the moment the stone was chiseled, the cosmic force was awakened, bound within the sculpture. The idol looms over all who dare approach, an imposing figure carved in the likeness of a mighty guardian. Its presence radiates a steady hum of magic, as the cosmic spirit channels the power of the stars through its massive stone form, granting incredible strength to those who worship it. The spirit within is said to possess wisdom from beyond the stars. Although tethered to the statue, the Cosmic Spirit is far from dormant—its power lies in wait. It an ancient consciousness attuned to the cosmos, ready to unleash the wrath of the stars upon those who would defy its power and threaten its domain.

The Temple of the Star will be created as soon as a prophet is chosen in the capital.
The Giant Idol will choose its champion from among the ranks of the Worldbreakers."

The banished spirits - enraged by their exorcism - will seek revenge, latching onto the mask and tainting its wearer with their lingering wrath. Whoever dons the Shamanic Mask becomes marked by vengeful entities, forever haunted by their malevolent presence. Unrest follows in the wake of the mask, as the spirits stir the air with dread whispers, sowing fear and discord among those nearby. Though it is a tool of healing and purification, the mask's inspires unease, for few can bear to stand in its presence for long."

#name "Dur-Halam"
#epithet "The Rising Flame"
#era 1
#descr "West of the Republic of Aurum, and east of the ocean, nestled in the great wilderness between two great rivers lies the sprawling mountain range of Dur and Halam, twin peaks which race each other to pierce the skies. In this land of sprawling mountains blanketed by dense and ancient forests dwell many flame-haired barbarian tribes. Though seemingly ruled by chieftains who retain power over worldly affairs of the tribes, it is the shamans and druids who act as spiritual guides and advisors to the chieftains who hold power by subtly influencing the decisions of the chieftains through portends and omens.
Ever since Aurum outlawed Druidry and launched pogroms against its practitioners, unease has spread among the druids and shamans of Dur-Halam. Their disjointed and constantly feuding tribes could never hope to stand against the full might of the Aurumian Republic, should the pogrom continue past the Purge of Nemeton. However, a recent and remarkable event, a great meteor setting the land aflame yet incredulously claiming no lives, has sparked the possibility of unifying the fractious tribes which have long been divided by blood feuds and internal conflict, and forging a nation capable of resisting any threat. Seizing on this opportunity the druids declared the star-fall a sacred omen, proclaiming a prophecy of a united Dur-Halam, destined to rise above other nations.
What began as a desperate bid to finally put to rest the endless cycle of infighting has taken on a life of its own and spiraled beyond the control of the druids and their subtle machinations. While their false prophecy worked, it worked too well, igniting a religious fervor among all the tribes who believed the gods themselves called for unification. In their fear of Aurum, the druids of Dur-Halam have inadvertently sparked a holy war that now spread far and wide across neighboring lands, threatening to drown the world in blood."

#newspell
#copyspell "Hurricane" -- So it can be cast only once
#name "Inscribe Sigil of the Bulwark"
#descr " A Sigil of the Bulwark is created; a magical construct designed to strengthen fortifications and make them much more resilient to sieges. These sigils require a substantial amount of Arcana to function and will feed on ambient magic. Only a single one may safely be supported in any single place. Though additional ones may be inscribed, they will quickly unravel should the land become devoid of ambient magic. 
However, the creation of such a sigil is a delicate process. Only one such sigil can be inscribed at a time, as attempting to place multiple sigils on the same fortification can destabilize the very walls they are meant to protect. "
#details "A single Sigil of the Bulwark will not influence Magic scales in a province and may be safely summoned. Every additional Sigl of the Bulwark summoned will increase Drain scales, and when the scales reach Drain 1 the Sigils will slowly start to unravel. Their disintegration will hasten as Drain scales increase."

#newspell
#name "Inscribe Sigil of Disruption"
#descr "Assaulting a fortified stronghold may be a daunting undertaking for Edranorians, whose numbers are often too few to overpower a much larger force entrenched behind walls. To overcome this challenge, they have devised Sigils of Disruption – powerful magical constructs designed to weaken and eventually crumble even the most formidable defenses.
Maintaining these sigils is not an easy task however. Each sigil requires a continuous flow of arcane energy to be channeled through it until the walls are finally reduced. Though weaker walls may be brought down almost instantly, it may take many mages channeling power for months to bring down particularly stubborn and well-defended fortifications."

#descr "In their pursuit of the knowledge, the mages of Edranor have uncovered many arcane secrets and caught a glimpse of a greater universe beyond. One such discovery is a spell capable of briefly opening a rift in the fabric of space, allowing Edranorians to cross vast distances instantly. The rift is very unstable, however, and requires the use of many magical gemstones to stabilize the exit point and prevent the rift from collapsing inwards, annihilating all those trying to step through. As a consequence of this arcane barrier, other spells directed at the exit point may be blocked and absorbed by the barrier.
Though this ritual may offer salvation in the face of annihilation, it is far too complicated to perform and requires the use of countless magical gems, and may save but a handful of people at a time as the rift collapses nearly as quickly as it appears."

Instead, it is the strong who offer themselves for sacrifice, and always willingly, for an unwilling sacrifice will lack both the willpower and conviction to do what is necessary to ensure the survival of their people, while a willing one will know that failure may result in the downfall of their people.

Through this ritual, mages willingly sacrifice themselves in an effort to imbue a pyramid of power with their own magic and will.

With their dying breath, the impaled mage channels the torment they have endured on the amplifier for many days, projecting it across the lands to overwhelm an enemy army with sudden, soul-crushing torment. Though this mental onslaught inflicts no physical harm, the psychological wounds it leaves can be deep and ever-lasting, scarring the minds of those who experience it."
#details "The army in the targeted province is attacked in a one round mock battle and a battle-wide effect is applied to the enemy force. An individual easy to negate MR roll for Weakness, Battle Fright, Mute, Feeble Minded, and Never Healing Wound is made against each unit.

This ritual will kill the casting mage in the process."

#descr "Hundreds upon hundreds of willing sacrifices are impaled on the Sacrificial Amplifier, left to die in the most excruciating manner possible as their very essence is syphoned away into small magical vessels designed to store their collective power. The number of vessels created depends on the number of sacrifices, for it typically takes as many as a hundred people to create but a single Arcane Vessel. However, the skill of the mages performing the gruesome channeling may greatly influence the imbuing process as well. More powerful mages can dramatically enhance the efficiency of the ritual, creating a far greater number of Arcane Vessels with the same number of sacrifices."
#details "500 population is killed in order to create 5 Arcane Vessels. Any additional summons will not add to the overall death toll in the province. If there is no population present at the end of the summoning process, all the summoning will fail. Make sure to not leave the province completely depopulated to ensure successful summoning."

If this energy is not deliberately directed by the sacrifices themselves or by the mages overseeing the ritual, it will simply dissipate into the aether, saturating the surrounding land with ambient magic. This ambient magic will gradually dissipate after a long time through a natural process which takes many months, but can be quite useful to the mages of Edranor even if short-lived. In a land suffused with magic, mages may find it much easier to perform their spells and investigate the Arcane, and indeed the secrets of ascension.

#name "Mana Vortex"
#descr "Unlike the mages of other lands who draw their magic powers from the Spheres, the elements, or the forces of Life and Death themselves, the mages of Edranor derive their magic from a more primal and visceral source: their own emotions, primarily that of pain. Excruciating agony directed by an adamantine will is what unlocks their magical potential, and what ultimately fuels their spell-casting. 
A Mana Vortex is a physical manifestation of these powers made real though the use of a complex ritual. Given its origins, it is no wonder that the manifestation of magic drawn from negative emotions appears as a violent and above all volatile vortex of wild and all-consuming magic. The vortex is in fact so erratic and seemingly temperamental that it requires a magical anchor to stabilize it and prevent it from devouring everything in its proximity. Despite the lingering danger of an untethered vortex, the benefits of one are far too great to dismiss their use. They are so great, in fact, that a Mana Vortex is in essence the dark and vengeful heart of any Edranorian city. At all times are the mages of Edranor capable of forming a sympathetic link with the Mana Vortex, regardless of physical distance. When formed, the emotions of the mage in question will suddenly flare up, matching the volatility and sheer destructive desires of the Mana Vortex, and empowering their magical abilities."

#newspell
#name "Sacrificial Amplifier "
#descr "The Sacrificial Amplifier is more than just an elaborate torture device, despite mainly serving to induce the most horrendous physical agony imaginable for the longest possible time of those impaled upon it before death finally claims them. For the people of Edranor, it is a magic amplifier through which they reshape their agony into a wellspring of power. Unlike other races, the mages of Edranor are not only used to enduring more sufferings than what most would consider possible, but are also capable of fully retaining their cognizance throughout the ordeal. These mages are capable of, quite literally, harnessing the excruciating pain inflicted upon them, and lashing out with it. The Sacrificial Amplifier becomes a conduit for this process, magnifying the pain and, by extension, the power that the mages draw from it.
While being impaled on the Sacrificial Amplifier spells certain doom for anyone involved, it is still gladly undertaken by many fervent mages when circumstances demand it, knowing that the agony they endure will enable them to cast spells of unparalleled potency—feats of magic that would otherwise be quite beyond their reach."

#descr "Unlike most mages who derive their power from the magical spheres or the elements, Edranorian mages draw their power from a far more unconventional source, negative emotions, primarily those of pain and anger. It is said that the first people to exhibit these peculiar powers came from the infamous slave mines of Musafir, where as many as a third of the slaves would perish yearly due to hardship of the mines, and the constant abuse they suffered at the hands of the cruel taskmasters. In time, the brutality inflicted upon the slaves was turned against their oppressors, and the suffering and rage that had once been used to subjugate them were ultimately wielded to destroy the slave mines and those who had enforced such cruelty. From the rubble of the slave mines, those who would become known as Edranorians - ‘the people of hardship’ – were born. A name derived from an ancient dialect of the few survivors who still remembered a time before the darkness of the mines. 
Today, Edranorian society is steeped in the dark legacy of those ancient mines. The horrors endured by their ancestors are recounted to instill a profound understanding of the consequences of weakness and the necessity of endurance. From a very tender age, Edranorians are conditioned to endure unconscionable brutality and - through sheer willpower – use their suffering to channel powerful magic. Using emotions as a source of magic is exceptionally challenging and quite perilous. Most mages dedicate their lives to mastering a single spell, with full mastery often taking a lifetime of practice, and many even die in the process, their bodies unable to withstand the trauma. Burning Warlocks are mages capable of binding and immobilizing their enemies by conjuring a prison made of flames around them. Those more skilled and adept can make the prison impossible to resist, or even cast it around numerous enemies at once."

From the rubble of the slave mines, those who would become known as Edranorians - ‘the people of hardship’ – were born. A name derived from an ancient dialect of the few survivors who still remembered a time before the darkness of the mines. 
Today, Edranorian society is steeped in the dark legacy of those ancient mines. The horrors endured by their ancestors are recounted to instill a profound understanding of the consequences of weakness and the necessity of endurance. From a very tender age, Edranorians are conditioned to endure unconscionable brutality and - through sheer willpower – use their suffering to channel powerful magic. Using emotions as a source of magic is exceptionally challenging and quite perilous. Most mages dedicate their lives to mastering a single spell, with full mastery often taking a lifetime of practice, and many even die in the process, their bodies unable to withstand the trauma. Burning Warlocks are mages capable of binding and immobilizing their enemies by conjuring a prison made of flames around them. Those more skilled and adept can make the prison impossible to resist, or even cast it around numerous enemies at once."

#descr " The people of Edranor are renowned for their tenacity and indomitable will, for how else could they hope to accomplish all they have already. Having the mental fortitude to weave complex spell and rituals while harnessing emotions such as pain and rage, while simultaneously containing the adverse effect they impose is no small feat. Edranorian mages dedicate their entire lives to mastering this balance, training to draw upon such emotions while maintaining clarity of mind to spellcast to the point of death. Given that such emotions cannot easily spurred on at will, most Edranorians rely on the sympathetic links they form with the Mana Vortex to be able to cast spell at all times.
However, this connection is not without its dangers. At times, a careless mage may become overwhelmed by the link, drawing too much from it to the point where they are no longer able to stop channeling and their magic starts to consume them from within, burning through their very being. Though those who fall into this trapping will for a brief time experience a profound surge of power, it is inevitably a death sentence.

A Diviner in his ardent form will gain +1 to all magic paths during battle, but will take 1AN dmg capped each combat round until he dies. Even if the Diviner doesn't die during battle, he will still be killed as soon as it ends. Upon death, the mage will explode in an AoE 1 effect."

Having the mental fortitude to weave complex spell and rituals while harnessing emotions such as pain and rage, while simultaneously containing the adverse effect they impose is no small feat. Edranorian mages dedicate their entire lives to mastering this balance, training to draw upon such emotions while maintaining clarity of mind to spellcast to the point of death. Given that such emotions cannot easily spurred on at will, most Edranorians rely on the sympathetic links they form with the Mana Vortex to be able to cast spell at all times.
However, this connection is not without its dangers. At times, a careless mage may become overwhelmed by the link, drawing too much from it to the point where they are no longer able to stop channeling and their magic starts to consume them from within, burning through their very being. Though those who fall into this trapping will for a brief time experience a profound surge of power, it is inevitably a death sentence.

A Spellbinder in his ardent form will gain +1 to all magic paths during battle, but will take 1AN dmg capped each combat round until he dies. Even if the Spellbinder doesn't die during battle, he will still be killed as soon as it ends. Upon death, the mage will explode in an AoE 1 effect."

#spr1 "./Confluence/EA_Edranor/Ascendant1.tga" 
#spr2 "./Confluence/EA_Edranor/Ascendant2.tga"
#descr "Though they are no longer of Edranor, some Ascendants still choose to linger for a time. Perhaps due to the bonds they once used to share with the people of this land, and that might still mean something to the ascended beings. Or perhaps out of simple curiosity, for they seem to retain only the faintest echoes of their former selves. While the Ascendants are revered and their presence valued, they are also a source of constant frustration. The way they perceive reality or how they communicate are wholly alien, and are of little to no help when it comes to understanding ascension and how they achieved it. If questioned about the process of ascension and their transformation, Ascendants respond in incomprehensible riddles that spark frustrating philosophical debate that ultimately lead nowhere. 
'Evoke the spheres and consume their shinning lights.' They might say, considering the matter resolved. Every question posed would receive a similarly incoherent response from every Ascendant, and each response would only lead to a dozen new questions.
Similarly to Ardent Mages, the Ascendants also appear as beings woven out of pure astral flames, but unlike them are in essence immortal, unfettered by their previous life and able to change their nebulous form to whatever is most suiting at the moment. Their understanding of the universe far surpasses that of other beings as death and dying are seemingly meaningless terms to them. Ascendants are magic incarnate and can simply reform themselves at will in any of the plains of existence when the need arises."

Though capable of assuming any form, Empyreans consistently choose humanoid manifestations, often adopting angelic appearances. Their radiant, ethereal wings and majestic features reflect their nature - symbols of their immense power and their enduring bond with the world they left behind but not abandoned. Their presence evokes a sense of awe among Edranorians, but also a deep comfort, for the Empyreans have not forgotten their origins.

#descr "To be added." -- It is unclear from whence the Star-eaters hail or how they come to be. Indeed, little is known of them apart from their clearly otherworldly origins and their voracious appetite for magic. Some scholarly minds speculate that these otherworldly beings are attracted to lands heavily infused with magic which then act like guiding beacons to them, drawing them across the vast dimensions. Once even a single Star-eater has appeared, others will follow in quick succession. If left unchecked the Star-eaters will quickly devour all ambient magic from a land and spread across the world like a plague of locusts, even devouring all the magic in the world. Indeed, despite their mesmerizing appearance, many a scholar describe them as little more than a plague of locusts that, instead of crops, devours all magic in its wake. Though the Star-eaters will leave a land completely devoid of magic for many seasons, they are completely harmless to living creatures. Despite their harmlessness the Star-eaters are the banes of mages and magical beings for obvious reasons.

Unlike most other scorpions, they are not solitary creatures and are often found in groups. Should one be spotted, others may not be far behind. Fiercely territorial, the black scorpions will hunt any animal which intrudes upon their territory and are best avoided if at all possible."

Chiseled to perfection, its gleaming surface made of gemstones seems to capture and contain living flames within it, giving it a radiant look and the appearance of flames flowing and dancing across its radiant facade. The heat emanating from the Gleaming Pyramid is so intense that the air around it warps and shimmers, scorching the lungs of any who breathe it, while the sand beneath its base melts into glass. Over time, the Gleaming Pyramid, like its counterparts, has begun to awaken, developing a will of its own and powers that could challenge even the mightiest of pretender gods. Endowed with the searing fury of the Edranorians, the pyramid is capable of conjuring a vast prison of flame and enwebbing and subduing entire armies.

The Gleaming Pyramid will cast a battle-wide Prison of Fire on the enemy army at the start of each battle."

#descr "The people of Edranor have developed a certain level of artistry when it comes to carving out stone monuments, even if their purpose for doing so isn't merely artistic expression. Even those which are rough-hewn still hold a certain allure with their irregular contours and neatly inscribed sigils. Unlike those, the Three Pyramids are created as both works of art and sophisticated magical construct. 
The Obsidian Pyramid is carved out of smooth, iridescent obsidian and stores a powerful magical focus at its center. Designed to absorb both the souls and magic of countless mages, the Obsidian Pyramid has started to develop a will of its own over time, and is slowly growing to rival the powers of god-like entities. Endowed with the iron will of the Edranorians, the Obsidian Pyramid is able to dominate the minds of those around itself.

The Obsidian Pyramid will autocast an AoE 15 Communion Slave spell around itself at the beginning of each battle."

Filled with an insatiable craving for knowledge and power born of hatred, the Sanguine Pyramid will continue to gorge itself on the life-force of all those around it, regardless of allegiance, for it represents naught but wanton destruction and an infinite thirst for power. By gormandizing the life-force and magic of countless beings the Sanguine Pyramid has developed a will of its own and an aspiration to consume everything.

The Sanguine Pyramid will cast Bloodletting which will impact 10% of the battlefield each combat round with a MR negates easily roll."

#descr "The Sundered are what remains of the mages of Edranor once their souls have been split in twine through crude and painful methods. They are the result of the first inquiries of Edranors into what would become a fervent quest for ascension, fueled by an almost desperate desire to finally rid themselves of all who those who wish them dead. Lacking, for want of a better term their soul, the Sundered are simply the echoes of the mages subjected to this ritual. They are the magical essence of the sundered mage driven by a cold and uncompromising desire to consume ever more magic, to the detriment of all other things, including their self-preservation. It is for this reason that the Sundered are barely considered sentient, living creatures. Unrestrained by the confines of the material universe, the Sundered still retain a vaguely humanoid appearance, as if holding on to some semblance of what they used to be, or perhaps simply lacking any imagination to assume any other form. Despite being powerful in their own right, the Sundered are tragic creatures, childlike in a sense, yet utterly monstrous and uncompromising at the same time. "

#descr "There are certain rituals which are deemed too dangerous and extreme even by those who have no qualms about torturing and mutilating children, or impaling their brethren on specially constructed pain conduits which very slowly burn them alive. Despite all these obviously disturbing warning signs, there are still some few who undergo these rituals, and fewer still who come through alive. A Purified is a mage who has achieved a form of ascension through a horrifying and agonizing month-long ritual in which their mortal husk is literally burned away by astral fires. Purified are beings of pure arcane energy and as such are difficult to harm with mundane weapons. They are capable of shooting projectiles of pure astral energy at their enemies."

From those dark beginnings, they've made great leaps in the study of the arcane arts, uncovering a completely new and previously unimaginable form of magic. Countless rituals, spells, incantations and magical constructs have been devised and created, and remarkable advancements in the elusive path to ascension has been made. While these achievements are monumental, they have been made significantly more attainable—though still far from effortless—thanks to the existence of the Pillars of Knowledge. These monolithic slabs hewn from ancient stones are overlain with countless intricate magical symbols interlaced is such a way to form a complex magical weave which significantly eases the study of the arcane by exuding a soothing aura on the mind and helping those near it focus on their research more easily."

The gems are utilized for rituals and inquiries into ascension, while the gold is used to trade with those few and spread-out villages willing to do so with the infamous people of Edranor.

A Pillar of Plenty will generate anywhere between 1 to 3 Astral gems, and 20 to 40 gold per month. This additional gem income will not be registered in the national gem income, but it will be visible in the gem income scrographs."

These rituals are the cornerstone on which the entire society of Edranor is built upon. They serve to cull the weak and powerless and help shape and expand the minds of those who remain. This brutal way of life leaves indelible marks on those who manage to endure it, for many do not survive their harrowing childhoods. Among the hardened people of Edranor, it is rare to find someone who does not bear the scars of their trials.
It is for this reason that the Pillars of Endurance are erected and inscribed with magical symbols of healing, for without it many would remain crippled for life. A fate much less terrible in Edranor than in other places, but one best avoided. These monolithic structures are inscribed with ancient, powerful symbols of healing, designed to mend the bodies of those who have survived the torment.

However, as their primary source of power comes from deeply negative emotions such as hate, rage, and torment, it comes as no surprise that the manifestation of those powers is frightfully unstable, tempestuous, and prone to violent discharges of energy. Despite the inherent risks of creating a Mana Vortex and one becoming untethered, they are still the primary tool of the Edranorians, for they allow them to draw upon the vortex's endless well of emotions at all times so that they are never left powerless. In order to stabilize the volatile and fluctuating magic of a Mana Vortex and keep it from annihilating everything for leagues around itself in a violent discharge of energy, an Arcane Anchor is needed. Should the anchor be destroyed the Mana Vortex will flare up and explode before a new anchor can be created."

The empire fell victim to a great cataclysm triggered by an ill-fated magical experiment which unleashed a torrent of magical energy that engulfed the empire in a relentless sandstorm. In a matter of days, the once-glorious cities were swallowed by shifting sands and in the blink of an eye the empire was resigned to legend.
Beneath the ever-shifting dunes, the remnants of this once-great empire still lie buried, along with its secrets and treasures. Among the artifacts lost to time is the Crown of the Dune Emperors, an object of immense power that is said to transform its wearer into sand, granting them near-immortality."

#descr "Used as a spell focus, the Magic Crystal channels and amplifies the wielder's power, allowing them to cast spells with far greater potency. However, the crystal rapidly drains the user's strength, enabling them to perform powerful magic, but only for a brief period before they collapse from exhaustion. Due to this extreme drain, it is ineffective for long or complex rituals, as the mage's energy would be depleted too quickly to reap any benefit. The draining effects of the crystal also erode the wielder’s mental defenses, leaving them vulnerable to outside influence and psychic attacks."

#descr "In the heart of Sharthalor’s endless dunes lies the Dweller in the Sand, the greatest and most ancient of scarab beetles. Its massive, amber-hued carapace glows like a dying sun, absorbing light and magic alike, casting an eerie, radiant aura across the sands. Its shell is etched with ancient runes, believed to be a mark of forgotten desert gods, and is said to be impenetrable even to the fiercest magical flames. Massive serrated pincers extend from its colossal frame, capable of tearing through entire stone outcroppings as if they were sand. 
The Dweller in the Sand is said to slumber beneath the desert for centuries at a time, stirring only when great events are about to reshape the world. Its awakening heralds change. Many desert tribes regard the Dweller as a deity, a guardian of the old ways, and of the ancient empire of Sharthalor prophesized to rise again one day from beneath the sands. "

#descr "Unlike the fleeting whirlwinds that dance across the Dead Wastes, the Fury of the Sands is an eternal maelstrom of golden sand and searing winds that pierce the heavens with its wrath. Its presence is a tempest of chaos, reshaping dunes into mountains and carving valleys where none existed, leaving behind scars that persist for centuries. Swirling at its base and spinning off from its tempestuous body, countless smaller Sand Devils spring into existence, as if the Fury's chaotic essence cannot be contained.
The desert tribes of Sharthalor believe the Fury is no mere spirit of the dead but the embodiment of an ancient god whose power was bound to the sands during the age of creation, whose howling winds are said to carry the voices of the long-forgotten dead. 
The Fury embodies the wrath of the land, punishing those who dare to disturb the balance of its sacred sands. Legends tell of those who have attempted to summon the Fury of the Sands through ancient rituals. Such endeavors always end in devastation, as the Fury heeds no mortal call but ever the desert itself. Only the most devout shamans claim to have glimpsed the heart of the storm, said to contain the essence of the ancient god and the spirits of those it has devoured over the eons.

The Fury of the Sands will continue to summon three Sand Devils of varying sizes each combat round, which will keep slowly fizzling out and disappearing."

#descr "In their quest for ascension the Edranorians have contacted and summoned something far beyond their comprehension - a multidimensional being from the depths of the Void which appears as a perfect, seamless cube. This strange Void being - or perhaps artifact - seems to distort reality itself, its sleek and seamless surface concealing an entire universe with countless ever-shifting worlds trapped beneath its flowing edges. 
The Void Tesseract defies all conventional understanding. Possessing the ability to teleport across vast distances, the Void Cube can appear and disappear at will, slipping between dimensions with ease. Immune to all mundane weapons, it exists beyond the reach of physical harm. Driven by an insatiable hunger for magic, it absorbs and consumes magical energies, leaving behind a trail of arcane desolation and devastation."

#descr "Asteria exists as a being of pure, radiant energy, an entity whose form shifts seamlessly between the realms of existence. Manifesting as a radiant constellation of interlocking starlight, her form reflects the cosmic truths she embodies. Asteria’s understanding of the universe is unparalleled, with her grasp of cosmic forces and astral phenomena extending beyond mortal comprehension. To question her about the nature of her ascension or the secrets of her being is to engage in an exercise in cosmic contemplation. Her responses, though profound, often leave seekers with more questions than answers, for she refuses to divulge any true insight into ascension, claiming true ascension is a personal discovery, one that each individual must achieve for themselves. Despite her exalted status, Asteria remains deeply entwined with the fate of Edranorians."

#selectnation 315
#name "Edranor"
#epithet "Pillars of Power"
#era 1
#descr "The unforgiving deserts of Sharthalor are home to a small group of magically-gifted people. Unlike other lands where mages draw their power from the elements, the Spheres, or the cosmic forces of Life and Death, the mages of Edranor derive their power from a far more intimate source—their own emotions. Having survived a long history of slavery, strife and death, the powers that they had discovered - and that permitted them to survive and break the shackled that bound them - were those based on agony, torment, and unbridled rage born of loss and desperation. 
Tempered by a century of constant strife - first imposed upon them by the slavers of Musafir, and then later self-inflicted - the people of Edranor have learned to harness their emotions to unlock their magical potential. From a very young age, children in Edranor are subjected to excruciating and unimaginably cruel rituals designed to teach them to draw upon their pain and anger as sources of power. Many - of those who survive childhood - wear permanent scars which remind them of the true price of power. The fallen, on the other hand, serve as a grim reminder of what happens to those who lack the power to protect themselves. 
Human sacrifice is common in Edranor, especially in times of dire need, though it differs in form to that practiced in most other lands. It is not the weak and the helpless who are preyed upon and then used in rituals against their will, for indeed there are no weak and helpless in Edranor. Instead, willing sacrifices are used. Mages willingly impale themselves on strange devices that serve both as instruments of torture which amplify one’s suffering as well as magical conduits capable of channeling the unending torment of the impaled to fuel rituals that would otherwise be impossible to perform. 
The people of Edranor worship only power, and neither temples nor priests hold any sway over their lands."
#summary "Race: Spell-casting humans. Commanders can attain ascension by creating all five pillars in the same land and entering the Mana Vortex.
Military: Nation of mages who use spells instead of conventional weapons. Units can be trained and promoted in the Mana Vortex site.
Magic: Fire, Astral, Blood. Can boost research, temporarily increase Magic scales, and place additional Mana Vortices. 
Priests: None. Preaching and temples have no effect. Dominion is spread through Pillars of Influence."
#brief "A desert nation of spellcasters whose power comes from pain and suffering. They do not use conventional weapons but spells rather. The mages of Edranor are very powerful and deadly, through few in number and easily killed."

These daemons no longer belong to either world—they are rejected by the savage brethren they abandoned, who now see them as corrupted by the new gods, and they are shunned by their civilized kin who yet remain in Khora. Twice damned for forsaking their fellows, these daemons now live in relative seclusion, ever keeping to the shadows and out of sight. During bright, cloudless nights, they will venture out and gather in forest glades they have come to call their own, and sing the songs they have learned under the tutelage of the Demiurges in the long years spent in Khora, and others yet they have since composed themselves in their self-inflicted exile. Much like the rest of the civilized daemons, Twilight Daemons too have shed much of their former aggression, rage, and brutish appearance. However, they have also mastered the art of staying hidden, moving silently through the world as they navigate their solitary existence.
Twilight Daemons will often sing and play their harps as they go into battle, both rallying and inspiring their allies and befuddling their foes. Those enemies who hear the enchanting twilight spellsongs will find themselves smitten and bewitched for a moment at the impossibility of hearing such divine music coming from profane creatures such as deamons.

Roughly one in five recruited Twilight Daemons will be equipped with a Daemonic Harp."

Though they are the architects of creation itself, the Demiurges are not uncreated beings, but rather a product of something greater than themselves. Outside of the material substratum known as Khora, the Demiurges manifest as imposing, centaur-like beings of tremendous might. However, within their formless interval the Demiurges transcend the constraints of the material universe, becoming formless entities, voices, or even mere ideas.
Demiurge Sentinels serve as the gatekeepers to the non-realm of creation. Though few in number, they are swift and powerful, possessing physical abilities far beyond those of any other beings.

Demiurge Sentinels' recruitment price can be lowered to 75 gold through the Music of the Spheres ritual which also increases their recruitment limit by +1."

#descr "Being wholly chaotic and governed by unrestrained desires, savage daemons make for very dangerous and fickle neighbors, especially for those who have wronged them. Those daemons who were ultimately overcome by their impulsive nature and the need to be free of any agents or influence are damned to walk a very precarious line between those they have twice rejected. Such daemons belong to the shadows and the darkest recesses of the land and they are called the daemons of the twilight. It is the Twilight Lords who preside over all matters relating to the daemons of the twilight, and navigate their kin through the dangerous wilds. Even in this the Demiurges have a purpose, for as much as the role of the daemons is to bridge the mortal sphere and the divine, it is the role of the twilight daemons to bridge the savages and Khora. Though daemons of the twilight mostly keep to themselves, their very existence among the savage tribes spreads the influence of the Demiurges; their art, knowledge, and wisdom."

They are immortal and completely unkillable by any means even in their restrained physical vessels, though they can still be banished from the material realm back to their formless interval.

When killed in battle, the Nine will retain any experience and traits gained, and will return to the recruitment pool, assuming Requiem is cast when battle reports of their deaths are received. Should Requiem not be cast, the slayed Demiurge will permanently be removed from the recruitment pool. A single Requiem will suffice for any number of Demiurges lost, though it must be cast as soon as one is killed."

When killed in battle, the Nine will retain any experience and traits gained, and will return to the recruitment pool, assuming Requiem is cast when battle reports of their deaths are received. Should Requiem not be cast, the slayed Demiurge will permanently be removed from the recruitment pool. A single Requiem will suffice for any number of Demiurges lost, though it must be cast as soon as one is killed."

#descr "Much like all denizens of the formless intervals, Sagittarians take on the form of towering centaur-like beings in the material universe. However, unlike other Demiurges, they spend considerable time in the material universe. It is said that all the stars in all the skies were shaped by the Sagittarians, for their song is prophetic and they see all that is, was, and ever will be, and thus know the universe and all the stars are theirs to shape. Somewhat more accustomed to this physical form of existence, the Sagittarians are even more imposing than the rest of the Demiurges, including the Nine. Being what they are - the song yet to be sung - Sagittarians have perfect vision and perfect foresight, and thus their arrows never fail to hit their mark, even if it might sometimes seem that way. Such an existence is surely an onerous one, for the Sagittarians are ultimately locked in their destinies and deprived of free will and choice, for all their great deeds have already come to pass, even though they are yet to undertake them."

The celestial spheres tremble as their voices and instruments resonate with an overwhelming, harmonious power. As the music unfolds, its ethereal beauty spreads like a wave, reaching across realms and worlds, captivating all beings. The influence of other gods falters, their dominion over mortal and divine alike fading in the face of the Nine’s perfect harmony. 
All hear this melody resounding deep within their souls, as if their wills are being reshaped by the symphony's divine intent. The power of the Nine, unstoppable and eternal, presses down upon the world, diminishing the claims of rival gods.

Should the Divine Symphony be allowed to play through to its conclusion, the influence of all pretender gods will eventually vanish, their hold on the world irrevocably broken."

Yet, as the song unfolds, the throne stirs, its divine glow dimming as fine cracks appear in its perfect surface. The delicate notes weave through its essence, unraveling the threads of its creation. With each passing moment, the throne’s power wanes, its structure faltering. If left unchecked, the final notes of the Hymn may shatter the throne, leaving nothing but silence and the faint echo of unmaking. To preserve the throne of ascension, the Hymn must either be silenced, or a protective dome raised around it to shield it from the melody’s unraveling touch."

#descr "The Three Harps of Khora are ancient, colossal instruments woven from the essence of creation. Positioned at the boundaries between Khora and the material universe, they serve as conduits for the Demiurges' primordial song — a melody that shapes reality, bringing creation from the void. Each harp is immense, towering above any mortal construct, yet they are not composed of any physical substance, but from magic and sound, existing only as long as the cosmic symphony endures. Their strings hum with the echoes of the Demiurges' song, vibrating with the potential to shape worlds or unravel them.
It is said that the Demiurges used the harps to teach the Daemons the first notes of the Music of the Spheres, the very same music that holds the universe together. Though the harps remain hidden in the depths of Khora, their influence reaches across all planes of existence. As the legend goes, when the last note from the Three Harps of Khora is played, the universe will be unmade.
Symphonium - The Harp of Genesis - embodies the first movement of the Demiurges' song, the act of creation. Its notes resonate with the raw energy of life and formation, calling forth matter and substance from the void. This harp was the first to hum the universe into being, its melody threading light and darkness, time and space into the physical realms. It is said that a single stroke upon its strings can weave new stars into the night sky or give birth to entire worlds. The Harp of Genesis, however, is elusive and unpredictable, for its power to create is inseparable from the chaos of Khora, and it often brings into being things unimagined, things both wondrous and strange."

Where the Harp of Genesis sings of creation, Aurorion - the Harp of Continuance - plays the notes that sustain reality. Its sound vibrates through all things, maintaining balance and harmony within the universe. Every breath, every heartbeat, and the movement of every celestial body can be traced back to this instrument’s subtle, perpetual melody. To hear its music is to feel connected to the very rhythm of existence itself, to perceive the underlying order that binds all things together. Yet, should the strings of the Harp of Continuance ever fall silent, the cosmos would unravel, descending into chaos and disarray as time and space begin to lose their coherence."

The most feared and misunderstood of the trio, Aerinthia - the Harp of Dissonance - represents the inevitable conclusion of all things. Its discordant notes echo the end of the Demiurges’ grand symphony, signaling the collapse of creation back into the formless void. Aerinthia does not merely destroy, it disassembles the essence of existence, returning matter, thought, and magic to the chaos from which they were born. When its strings are plucked, the sound heralds endings; the fall of empires, the death of stars, the closing of epochs. The Harp of Dissonance is both a warning and a promise, the final sound that will play when the universe's song draws to its ultimate conclusion."

#newspell
#name "Requiem" -- Mass for the Dead / Elegy
#descr "Through the Nine are quite immortal perhaps in all the realm but their own formless interval, their physical forms can still be vanquished and banished back to their material substratum known as Khora. When a Demiurge is slayed, it may take many years, or perhaps even centuries for their song to reach the material spheres again. Unlike the lesser Demiurges who may be freely ushered into the world with a potent enough spellsong, the songs of the Nine are too great to be carried by anyone other than themselves. Once their song has passed from the material realm, it cannot be freely summoned back by any means. However, when a Demiurge dies, their song, their essence, can be captured before it passes through the material realms by performing a Requiem. Such a complex act is not easily done, and holds a number of caveats which further complicate the matter. None but the Nine are powerful enough to perform such a spellsong, and there is but a brief window of opportunity to perform it before the song of the slayed Demiurge passes out of reach."
#details "When cast on the turn any of the nine Demiurges die, it will return the killed ones to the recruitment pool and enable them to be recruited once again. As Demiurges are unique commanders they will carry over any experience, empowerments, or other traits acquired. If the province is lost during the turn Requiem is cast, it will result in a failed ritual and the dead Demiurges will remain dead for good."

As such the part of Khora that touches the Terrestrial sphere is filled with numerous magical instruments enchanted to play their tunes endlessly, and soothe the burden of the Demiurges until their grand designs in the material universe are complete."

#selectnation 301
#name "Khora"
#epithet "The Music of the Spheres"
#era 1
#descr "Khora is a formless interval. It is an otherworldly place that exists outside of the physical universe, and none of the beings inhabiting it have either shape nor location, much like the realm itself. Khora is sometimes also referred to as the non-realm of creation. It represents the unintelligible substratum of the material universe and it is the realm from which all other realms were given shape, or rather sung into being by the Demiurges, the primordial gods of this realm, and the shapers of the material universe. In the formless realm the Demiurges can turn amorphous, into voices, or ideas, though what they really are is the song that echoes across the universe. Their song brings with it creation, and it is said that when their grand symphony is finally played out across the spheres, the universe will come to an end and unravel.
Though Khora is a formless plane without a location, it is connected to the material universe at certain junctions. One such junction, whether by design or happenstance, is in the land of the Daemons, savage and irrational beings of great brutality - but also vast potential - to whom the Demiurges have gradually started revealing the secrets of the cosmos and teaching them the Music of the Spheres." 
#summary "Race: Demiurges and Daemons. Cannot construct national forts, can only create them through rituals. 
Military: Powerful capital only sacreds, limited recruit everywhere sacreds, light infantry, heavy infantry, archers, stealthy units, giant cavalry. 
Magic: Water, Astral, Nature, rare Fire and Earth. Can manipulate scales to a degree via items.
Priests: Powerful."
#brief "Khora is a land of primordial and timeless creator-gods named the Demiurges and of numerous Daemonic tribes, as of yet an uncivilized and brutish people, but one for whom the Demiurges foresee greatness."

#newspell
#name "Grow Fort" --  for G4/G5 once available for modding
#descr "In Nemeton, where everyone lives in communion with nature and under the protection of sylvan glamour, defensive structures are a rare sight. In the rare instances when they are required, they are not constructed, but are grown rather. Though a rather simple process, it requires much patience for it can often take much longer to grow a fort rather than build one, and the act cannot be hurried along. To create a fortification, a sylvan will extend its roots far and wide beneath the ground, and then grow thick, living walls out of brambles and vines. The speed of the growth of such a defensive structure will be highly dependent on the fertility of the land, and in places where life and nature do not prosper, it will be impossible to grow a bramble fort. Continuously maintaining the bramble fort will take up all of the energy from a sylvan and will render it powerless. By severing the roots that feed into the bramble fort, a sylvan can regain its magical abilities, though the fort itself will swiftly wither away and crumble."
#details "A Sylvan may cast this spell to create a bramble fort in any terrain type. The spell has a 8/12/16/24/32% chance of creating a bramble fort depending on the current Growth scales. Once a fort has been created in the province, a Sylvan (not necessarily the casting one) will be turned immobile and will no longer be able to uproot or move, effectively binding it to the province. The bound Sylvan can be released and turned mobile again assuming it destroys the fort. The bound Sylvan must be the one to destroy the fort."

#descr "The Druid of the Grove ventures deep into the heart of the forest in search of a fitting location to perform a most holy druidic ritual. Once in a place where the presence of many ancient spirits of the forest can be felt, the druid will prepare for the ritual and spend the next few days tattooing his entire body and covering it in magical, biding symbols. Once the placing of tattoos is complete, the druid will establish a communion with one of the spirits of the forest and be joined with both a chosen and willing spirit. The druid will take on the characteristics of his spirit animal which will be bound within the druid's tattoos. The tattoos will automatically flare to life any time the druid is in peril. Some druids have also been known to create amulets which allow them to temporarily take physical form of their spirit animals."
#details "After performing this ritual, the casting Druid of the Grove will be able to transform into either a giant Wolf, Bear, or a Boar in battle by though the use of an eponymous forgable amulet. When a matching item is equipped, a transformation spell can be cast to turn into the animal form for the duration of the battle. Aside from gaining tattoos which will be automatically activated in battle, the druid will also inherit some of the traits of their animal chosen.

Outcome 1: Wolf tattoo [4], +4AP, +3HP, 
Outcome 2: Bear tattoo [5], +7HP,
Outcome 3: Boar tattoo [8], +4HP, +2Morale, Slash Resistance."

#descr "The Druids of the Grove form an ancient order of priests of Nature who care for wildlife and perform ancient ceremonies to appease the spirits of the land. They are learned men of diverse fields of study, though all of them primarily study Nature magic. 
In recent years the druidic orders have all but been wiped out by aggressive Aurumian campaigns to ban and destroy all spirit-based worship. It is only in Nemeton that the druids were given respite and protection by those same spirits of the land. Now the druids care and tend to the Sylvan groves, and in return the Sylvans extend their glamour to the druids, sheltering them from prying eyes, and eager swords.
While in forests, the Druids of the Grove can draw upon the knowledge of the land to gain insight into Nature magic."

Once fully reformed, the druid will be restored to their former self, unscathed by the damage that caused their demise. This spell is not without its limitations, however. If a big enough portion of the swarm is destroyed, their rebirth will fail, and they will be lost forever.  "

#name "The Lady of the Forest"
#descr "Glúingel, the Lady of the Forest, is a lithe yet imposing figure of otherworldly grace. She appears in a gown which flows like living moss, armed with a spear of thorns and an enchanted, verdant shield forged from the heart of the wilds. Her hair is woven with wildflowers that bloom and fade with the seasons, and her piercing eyes are said to mirror the emerald canopy of the Sacred Groves and hold untold wisdom of nature.
According to the lore of Nemeton, Glúingel is no mere mortal but a champion chosen by the forest itself. Born from the heart of the Sacred Groves, she is said to have emerged fully grown from a flowering tree whose petals glowed like silver in the moonlight. The druids of Nemeton believe her to be a gift from the gods; a protector of the wilds and a bridge between themselves and the untamed forces of the natural world. Her presence inspires awe in those who encounter her, and many believe her to be a goddess in physical form.
Every autumn, the Sacred Groves bloom with vibrant amber flowers that glow faintly in her presence, said to be gifts from the forest itself which contain fragments of Glúingel’s power.
Despite her near-mythical status, Glúingel is not seen as a ruler but a servant. She exerts no dominion over the world, but acts to ensure neither humanity nor nature oversteps its bound, preserving the harmony that sustains the world."

#name "Weaver"
#descr "Lorendil the Weaver was once renown as the greatest warrior of Nemeton. One fateful day, after a great and bloody battle, as he stood victorious amidst the fallen, a scornful mystic, clinging to life with her final breaths, revealed a horrifying truth to him before expiring. 
Lorendil, the mightiest of warriors, was destined to cause the destruction of Nemeton. The weight of this revelation shook Lorendil to his core. Stricken by guilt and fear, he forsook violence forever. On that day, he cast aside his sword, abandoning the path of bloodshed, swearing never to take another life Instead, he sought to redeem himself by taking on the mantle of a healer to atone.
Lorendil devoted himself to the art of healing, immersing himself in the ways of Druidry. In time, he became a master healer known as the Weaver for his ability to thread the magic into his craft to mend wounds, cure ailments, and restore life. His renown as a healer eclipsed his fame as a warrior, and soon he was regarded as one of the finest in all of Nemeton and beyond.
Then came a day that would alter his path once again. A messenger from the Aurumian Republic arrived, bearing summons for Lorendil. The Rex Aurum – the king of Aurum – had fallen gravely ill and the most qualified healer to face the king’s affliction was requested, Lorendil. Despite his best efforts, Lorendil’s powers proved inadequate. The disease was too strong, and the king died under his care.
The death of Rex Aurum was met with fury. The people, desperate for someone to blame, turned on the healers and the druids. Druidry was now outlawed by the Aurumian Senate which had assumed power, and its practitioners were hunted down, branded as traitors and killers. Barely escaping with his life, Lorendil fled, abandoning the grand halls of Aurum to take refuge in the shadows of the forests he once called home. While his past as a warrior is long behind him, the echoes of his prophecy have begun to haunt Lorendil again."

#descr "The Ancient Sylvans are rare and unsettling beings, older than most forests and wise beyond measure. These ancient spirits have seen countless seasons pass, their bark gnarled by the weight of time, their once-proud branches now twisted and brittle. Unlike their younger kin, Ancient Sylvans exude a foreboding aura, their presence heavy with the echoes of centuries past. 
The passage of time has warped their nature. Some say the Ancient Sylvans have gone mad in their long existence, their minds touched by the burden of endless years. Others believe they have seen too much of the world and its decay, that their once-pure purpose has become obscured by a growing darkness. Their motives are unclear and their trustworthiness even more so as the Ancient Sylvans are prone to seemingly unprovoked acts of cruelty and hostility.
Though their trunks may have grown frail with age, they still wield the vast magic of their kin and their mastery of it has only deepened, albeit in unpredictable and dangerous ways. Their spells are often fueled by paranoia and suspicion, casting an ominous pall over their groves. When approached, their gaze seems to see through all things, and one never knows if they will offer guidance or condemnation."

Those who approach the flower with reverence may find it glowing brighter in their presence, as though acknowledging their intent.

A being of profound power and serenity, the Spirit is often regarded as an animalistic god of nature, embodying the untamed wilderness. Its presence brings an otherworldly calm. Those who find themselves in its presence are lulled into a deep and dreamless slumber, allowing the Spirit to traverse the forests unchallenged. Those fortunate enough to witness its spectral form before sleep claims them describe it as a profound and humbling experience; an encounter with something ancient, eternal, and untamed."

However, the use of the Blood Rose is somewhat disapproved of in Nemeton, as it is considered by some to be a primitive form of Blood magic.

Holding the Blood Rose will cause profuse bleeding."

#descr "Deep within the sacred groves of Nemeton dwell ancient and powerful spirits of the forest, called the Sylvans. These spirits reside within strong, proud oak trees and are able to animate their old and rigid bark and branches, and stir them into action. As such, Sylvans are commonly mistaken for the ancient Treelords, and while they share certain similarities, they yet share no common link or ancestry.
The Sylvans use their mastery of Nature magic to create powerful spellweavings, shield the forests of Nemeton from prying eyes, and even create resources needed for weapons, quickly growing branches and trunks for woodworking and even sensing ore deposits close to the roots of the forests. In turn, the druids of Nemeton tend to, and protect the Sylvans. Their magic, however, is not without limit, and as soon as the guardians leave the forests, the glamour and enchantment granted to them will instantly shatter. Sylvans are capable of uprooting themselves in order to travel large distances, though not at an inconsiderable risk, as while uprooted, Sylvans lose some of their magic power, and grow weaker and weaker each month, until they eventually wither away and die. While in a forest, Sylvans are virtually undetectable, and hard to find even when not.

#name "The Golden One"
#descr "The Golden One is a colossal, awe-inspiring bear, an ancient and primordial god of nature tied to the turning of seasons. As the embodiment of Autumn, its ethereal form radiates the golden hues of a forest at its most vivid, a living tapestry of fading sunlight and falling leaves. Its fur bristles with shimmering foliage, each leaf shifting between hues of amber, gold, and fiery orange.
Massive and imposing, the Golden One moves with the weight of ages, its steps leaving trails of golden leaves that dissolve into the wind.  
As a seasonal spirit, the Golden One emerges when the world begins its descent into slumber, heralding the time of harvest and reflection. Its presence brings both beauty and quiet solemnity, marking the balance between life and decay. Despite its tranquil aura, the Golden One is a fierce protector of the natural cycle. Those who disrupt the harmony of the season or exploit the land may find themselves facing its wrath, its mighty roars shaking the very earth and its golden leaves swirling into a tempest.

The Golden One will receive increased protection, attack, defense and strength during Autumn, 50 Fall power, as well as a +1 boost to Nature and Earth magic." -- Has Autumn shape

#clearmagic 
#descr "The Viridian Queen is an ancient spirit of nature. She inhabits a wooden statue carved long ago by unknown hands. The statue’s surface is smooth and weathered, shaped not by tools but seemingly by time and magic itself. Her hair cascades in long, flowing strands of vibrant moss, glistening with dew, and shifting subtly as though it breathes with the wind.  
Legends say the Viridian Queen emerged when the first forests took. Some believe her wooden statue was shaped by the forests themselves as a vessel for her spirit, while others claim she was the creation of druids who sought to bind the will of nature into a single form. Regardless of her origins, the Queen’s power is undeniable. She is said to nurture the wilds, her presence causing the land to bloom with life and abundance. In spring, when the Viridian Queen’s power is at its zenith, all things grow and bloom. During this season nature’s magic coalesces within the sacred groves she watched over, forming rare emerald gems imbued with the pure essence of the wild. 

The Viridian Queen will increase Growth scales by +1 worldwide during the whole of Spring, as well as generate 1d3 Nature gems in all groves of Nemeton."

#name "Tree of Life"
#descr "The Tree of Life is an ancient, colossal tree, its vast canopy reaching toward the heavens and casting a serene, dappled glow over the land below. Its bark shimmers faintly, spiraling around a core of pure magic - a radiant, swirling wisp nestled within its trunk.
Its leaves, ever-changing with the seasons, glisten with an otherworldly light, emerald green in spring, golden in autumn, and faintly luminous at night, as though imbued with the stars' radiance. It is said that its roots burrow deep into the heart of the world, intertwining with all of creation and sustaining the natural order.
The most ancient and mad of Sylvans claim that the Tree of Life grew from the first seed planted by the gods to tether the material world to the realm of magic. Born at the dawn of time, the Tree of Life grew from this spark of creation, its magic blossoming alongside the world itself. Over the eons, its roots dug deep into the foundations of the world, infusing it with magic which seeps into the soil, rivers, and air, nourishing the world and all life within it. It is said that without the Tree of Life, magic might wither and fade.

Very seldomly, the Tree of Life’s Nature magic skill will increase. The higher the dominion value, the higher the chance. 
The Tree of Life will spawn 5d6 animated trees and bushes during battle."

#selectnation 310
#name "Nemeton"
#epithet "Hidden Groves"
#era 1
#descr "With Aurum's swift rise to power and prominence came the persecution of the numerous, scattered druidic circles. In the ensuing years of Aurum's aggressive military campaigns many druids died, but many also fled far and wide, until they discovered an ancient and hidden grove unlike any they had ever seen. There, the exiled druids were given shelter and protection by the primordial spirits of the forest, called the Sylvans. Now, the druids of Nemeton and the Sylvans live in communion and safeguard each other against would-be intruders. 
The druids of Nemeton live in small communities centered around sacred Sylvan groves. They rarely build permanent settlements or fortifications as they have little use for them. Instead, they rely on powerful Sylvan enchantments to shelter them from prying eyes. The people of Nemeton are capable of moving unseen through forests, as the very forests guide and reinvigorate their every step. Even the weapons they carry strike with the power of the forest and entangle those struck by them."
#summary "Race: Humans. Have no use of forts. Can only place additional settlements in forests, by moving Sylvans and creating new groves. 
Military: Light and medium infantry, light boar cavalry, archers. National troops become stealthy while in forest, and receive weapons that can entangle. 
Magic: Water, Earth, Nature, Glamour. National mages gain +1 Nature magic while in forest.
Priests: Average.
Sites: World Tree increases Growth to a maximum of 3. Wise Old Oak awakens once a year from dormancy."
#brief "Nemeton is a sanctuary to numerous druids, exiled and hunted down by Aurum. It is also the home of the Sylvans, ancient and powerful spirits of the forest."

But when a devastating plague swept across her kingdom, taking her people in droves, and among them her loved ones, Anushet’s faith faltered. Consumed by grief, she turned to forbidden arts, defying the will of the gods in a desperate bid to bring back her loved ones.
Through her relentless pursuit, Anushet devised methods to perfectly preserve the dead, mastering embalmment and mummification to halt the decay of their bodies. Yet, preservation alone was not enough. After years of research and forbidden experimentation, she created the Mask - an artifact 
capable of pulling souls from the afterlife and binding them back to their bodies.
Though her efforts succeeded, the gods were furious. The souls she summoned returned broken, their eternal rest disrupted. The plague victims rose not as her loyal subjects but as restless horrors, spreading plague throughout her once-great empire yet again, reaping many more people this time. For her hubris and defiance, the gods cursed Anushet to eternal suffering, binding her soul to the very mask she had created. Yet even in her torment, Anushet has not learned her lesson. Through the Mask, she whispers alluring promises to those who dare to wear it, offering forbidden knowledge and the power to bring the dead back to life—though the price for such power remains as devastating as ever."

Once locked in place, the collar severs the wearer’s connection to the arcane - rendering even the most powerful mage helpless - and suppresses their resolve and willpower, leaving its victim docile and pliable. Beyond suppressing magic, it can also be turned into a magical conduit and used to empower the collar’s master, expanding their own grasp over the arcane.

This empire rose to greatness under the rule of visionary emperors who harnessed the power over the very sands that now conceal its ruins, transforming its arid lands into a flourishing center of culture and magic, building monumental structures and commanding vast armies of both mortal and mystical beings.
Yet, no empire is immune to decline, and Sharthalor’s zenith was not to last. The empire fell victim to a great cataclysm triggered by an ill-fated magical experiment which unleashed a torrent of magical energy that engulfed the empire in a relentless sandstorm. In a matter of days, the once-glorious cities were swallowed by shifting sands and in the blink of an eye the empire was resigned to legend.
Beneath the ever-shifting dunes, the remnants of this once-great empire still lie buried, along with its secrets and treasures. Among the artifacts lost to time is the Crown of the Dune Emperors, an object of immense power that is said to transform its wearer into sand, granting them near-immortality."

Consuming even a pinch of these enchanted spices may expand the user’s consciousness, unlocking hidden reserves of magical potential and opening the mind to new dimensions of thought and power. However, indulging in these spices comes at a steep cost. Continued use clouds the mind, making prolonged focus difficult, and leaves users physically drained. Over time, indulgence will sap the vitality, leaving those who overuse the spices frail and withered. Despite the price, those who indulge find the allure almost impossible to resist, their dependence growing as their health wanes.
The Chest of Strange Spices is a tempting tool for those willing to risk their health for a fleeting surge of magical brilliance, and is said to be much sought after by scholars, sorcerers, and mystics across the realms."

Their will becomes subservient, their actions dictated by the whims of the one they serve. The servitude is not a mere contract but a binding of the soul, a constant reminder of their debt.

Hidden beneath the city's heart, lit by flickering lanterns and veiled in shadow, its labyrinthine design will cater to the discerning few who seek the extraordinary and the forbidden." 
#details "Begins the construction of the 'Black Emporium'. In order to construct the site, many scores of slaves must be present. The more there are, the higher the chances of constructing the site. Having at least several hundred is typically required. At least a single Slave Driver must have arrived to the capital from a foreign province in order to commence the construction.

The Black Emporium will generate a single random magical item (5-7 level) each month once built. Only a single of the four available sites may be chosen.

Once the wonder has been completed any remaining slaves will be slowly incorporated into the population over the course of many months. Any new slaves brought will also serve to increase local population by roughly 350 population per Slave Driver brought."

#descr "Though the traveler tribes of Musafir are typically small in size, sometimes numbering just a handful of people, very few choose to live a secluded and solitary life as that more often than not is a death sentence in such an unforgiving environment. Such individuals are the Poisoners who have given up on the nomadic way of life and have settled in their own tiny strips of the desert, living off the Harsh Sand. 
Poisoners are commonly regarded by the travelers as being exceptionally skilled hunters, for indeed the alternative to being a skilled hunter would almost certainly be a dead hunter in their world. These hardened desert recluses hunt the gigantic black scorpions that dwell in the deserts of Musafir and extract poison from their glands which they use to coat their arrows with. The scorpion venom acts as a paralytic and is strong enough to immobilize those hit by it."

The Desert Outriders prefer to ride horses to the much more widely used camels due to their often great need for haste. These horsemen typically scout ahead of big caravans or traveling tribes, or act as vanguards. As such Desert Outriders need to be able to cross great distances at times and only employ the fastest horses. Though they are equipped with much lighter gear than most other light cavalry, the tremendous force of their charge has been often known to break well-equipped and well-armored ranks. The remarkable speed of their horses also allows them to run down any stragglers after a minor skirmish, or outrun a superior army that seeks to engage a poorly equipped force."

In years past they used to roam the deserts in search of prey, frequently targeting small and poorly equipped bands of travelers whom they would then sell into slavery at slave auctions. More recently, however, with the ban on tribal slavery, the slave trade has shifted to enslaving the Tigrans, a race of tigers that dwell in the forests or open savanna plains. While the Tigrans are a fierce and proud race, the cat people are still unsophisticated and relatively easy to catch with nets and fast horses, which has led the slavers to abandon their classical camel mounts in favor of fast horses. Most slavers are somewhat cowardly. If they find prey capable of mounting a resistance, they will more often than not retreat and seek out easier victims instead."

In Musafir, there would likely be no traveling tribes without camels, so it is little wonder that these beasts hold a special significance and are considered to be almost holy. Their worth is such that it is said that a Musafir husband takes better care of his camels than he does of his wives. Indeed, the wives of Musafir take care of their husbands, the husbands take care of the camels, and in turn the camels provide for them all. Camels are working animals especially suited to their desert habitats and are a vital means of transport for nomads and their cargo. On the long journeys they provide milk and meat and even textiles as the clothes the nomads wear and the tents they sleep in are woven out of camel hair. A tribe's wealth is often measured in the number of camels it possesses. In times of war, these great beasts are also used as battle mounts. Though not as fast as Musafir horse breeds, the dromedary of Musafir is much more reliable, capable of going up to several days without water, and easier to ride."

Once in such a hypnotic state, the Rocs will grab and fly off with the unfortunate victims, likely to be devoured by this carnivorous bird, or fed to its younglings."

With the new god of the Harsh Sands on the rise and a loose alliance of the nomadic tribes on the brink of forming a nation under united leadership for the first time, the need to wander the desert has lessened. Even so, such an integral part of the Musafir culture cannot be changed overnight for even the very word Musafir means traveler.

Travelers are small nomadic tribes that migrate from land to land and typically consist of roughly a thousand people. As the various tribes of Musafir still harbor some small amounts of distrust against one another, no more than a single tribe, a single group of Travelers, will move from nor settle in a particular land at the same time.

Recruiting Travelers will remove roughly 1k population from the province. To settle Travelers in a province, simply change shape. Only a single Traveler tribe may settle per month."

It is their unquestionable leadership and wisdom that keeps the tribes moving ever-forward between the oases on the harsh desert trails. Each Wise Master imposes his own laws within his respective tribe and looks towards the safety and well-being of his people. Though historically the tribes of Musafir often competed against each other over access to the small patches of rich grassland and the sporadic oasis, as of late the tribes have banded together to form a loose coalition under the new, self-proclaimed god of the Harsh Sands. In times of war, the Wise Masters will lead the warriors of their tribes on mounted camels into battle personally, for a tribe lives or dies together, both man and camel alike."

#descr "The Slave Masters lead the Sharir, the slaver tribes of Musafir. With the recent shift in politics and an explicit ban on the enslavement of other tribes, the Sharir now look beyond the borders of the desert to ply their gruesome trade. Though the ban on slavery only prohibits them from enslaving the Travelers, it does not prohibit slavery as a whole. Consequently, the Sharir now frequently venture into foreign and unsuspecting lands where they enslave entire unwary villages and bring the captured populous back in shackles to the crowded Sharir dungeons to await auctions at slaver markets. In one such recent foray into the neighbouring lands, the Sharir have discovered a race of ferocious but primitive tigers, deemed to make perfect slaves, after being properly broken down.
Slave Masters command great authority though fear and are very skilled at keeping the tigrans and human slaves alike in line through the indiscriminate use of their whips.  

A Slave Master with no less than 5 Slavers under his command will 'capture' as many as 200 population a month while stealthy in non-Musafir lands. Up to 1000 population can be captured at maximum at any given time by a Slave Master, though the Slave Master can be brought back to Musafir lands at any point to add the captured population to a Musafir province. Only a single Slave Master per province may operate in enemy lands to capture population, and additional groups will provide no benefit."

#descr "The Slave Masters lead the Sharir, the slaver tribes of Musafir. With the recent shift in politics and an explicit ban on the enslavement of other tribes, the Sharir now look beyond the borders of the desert to ply their gruesome trade. Though the ban on slavery only prohibits them from enslaving the Travelers, it does not prohibit slavery as a whole. Consequently, the Sharir now frequently venture into foreign and unsuspecting lands where they enslave entire unwary villages and bring the captured populous back in shackles to the crowded Sharir dungeons to await auctions at slaver markets. In one such recent foray into the neighbouring lands, the Sharir have discovered a race of ferocious but primitive tigers, deemed to make perfect slaves, after being properly broken down.
Slave Masters command great authority though fear and are very skilled at keeping the tigrans and human slaves alike in line through the indiscriminate use of their whips. 

This Slave Master will soon begin selling off captured slave to the locals. This action will take place on the following month in whatever Musafir province the Slave Master is located at the time."

#descr "Being a wandering people, constantly on the move, the nomads of Musafir travel far and wide. On their distant journeys they always acquire new, exotic things that can often be sold for a hefty profit in some other part of the world. These tribes that travel between other tribes of Musafir are the Tajir, or the traveling merchants. Spice Caravans are formed from groups of merchants who traverse the world and make their living selling spices in various tribes and settlements. Due to their particular way of life, the Tajir have become crafty and skilled salesmen and are well known for driving a hard price if a lucrative business opportunity is at hand.

Spice Caravans travel within the confines of the borders of Musafir, always moving from city to city, selling their goods to the locals. Though the prices they fetch selling their spices in friendly Musafir settlements are favorable, they are not as favorable as those the Distant Spice Caravans fetch traveling to other, distant nations where such goods are rare and luxurious. Though the Spice Caravans do not follow the Spice Trail to other realms, they are still capable of fetching considerable profits in those lands where a Musafir settlement is located.

Spice Caravans can trade by entering other Musafir settlements, those of Azraq, Slavers, Farseers, and other Tajir. No more than two caravans a month can hope to sell their goods at any given Musafir settlement before the saturation of the market drives down the price too much for a profit to be had."

#descr "Being a wandering people, constantly on the move, the nomads of Musafir travel far and wide. On their distant journeys they always acquire new, exotic things that can often be sold for a hefty profit in some other part of the world. Spice Caravans are groups of merchants who traverse the world and make their living selling spices in various settlements and forts. Due to their particular way of life, the merchants of Musafir have become crafty and skilled salesmen and are well known for driving a hard price if a lucrative business opportunity is at hand.

Distant Spice Caravans follow the Spice Trail to other realms, hoping to drive up their prices in the far reaches of the world where their goods are not a common sight - like in the lands of Musafir - and are often considered something of a luxury. The price a Distant Spice Caravan can fetch in a foreign city is considerably higher than in Musafir settlements. Many a caravan even take the long journeys to the sprawling markets in the capital cities of distant lands. The profit to be had in such a venture can be enough to set a trader up for life, though the trip is often not one without risk either, as the caravans sometimes get attacked during their travel and even betrayed by those they traded with by being rounded up and executed after. 

Distant Spice Caravans can trade by entering the cities of other nation. No more than two caravans a month can hope to sell their goods at any given distant city before the laden caravans of Musafir saturate the market and drive down the price too much. Distant Spice Caravans can also gauge their prices in foreign capitals, though traveling such vast distances can be dangerous and incur great upkeep expenses during the many-month travel."

#descr "The numerous and far-flung tribes of Musafir have long since accustomed themselves to a harsh, nomadic way of life, always moving from land to land, in search of better fortune and a permanent oasis to call their own. With the new god of the Harsh Sands on the rise and a loose alliance of the nomadic tribes on the brink of forming a nation under united leadership for the first time, the need to wander the desert has lessened. Even so, such an integral part of the Musafir culture cannot be changed overnight for even the very word Musafir means traveler.

Travelers are small nomadic tribes that migrate from land to land and typically consist of roughly a thousand people. As the various tribes of Musafir still harbor some small amounts of distrust against one another, no more than a single tribe, a single group of Travelers, will move from nor settle in a particular land at the same time.

Unlike the Travelers, the Traveler Caravans will also disassemble and pick up any presently located building into building blocks to be carried off with the caravan on numerous beasts of burden. Though such an undertaking requires many camels and is expensive, it is also often worth it. Traveler Caravans cannot be recruited in the City of Musafir for none would allow such an act."

#descr "The numerous and far-flung tribes of Musafir have long since accustomed themselves to a harsh, nomadic way of life, always moving from land to land, in search of better fortune and a permanent oasis to call their own. With the new god of the Harsh Sands on the rise and a loose alliance of the nomadic tribes on the brink of forming a nation under united leadership for the first time, the need to wander the desert has lessened. Even so, such an integral part of the Musafir culture cannot be changed overnight for even the very word Musafir means traveler.

Travelers are small nomadic tribes that migrate from land to land and typically consist of roughly a thousand people. As the various tribes of Musafir still harbor some small amounts of distrust against one another, no more than a single tribe, a single group of Travelers, will move from nor settle in a particular land at the same time.

This Traveler Caravan is currently in the process of settling down and assembling a laboratory and a temple."

#descr "The numerous and far-flung tribes of Musafir have long since accustomed themselves to a harsh, nomadic way of life, always moving from land to land, in search of better fortune and a permanent oasis to call their own. With the new god of the Harsh Sands on the rise and a loose alliance of the nomadic tribes on the brink of forming a nation under united leadership for the first time, the need to wander the desert has lessened. Even so, such an integral part of the Musafir culture cannot be changed overnight for even the very word Musafir means traveler.

Travelers are small nomadic tribes that migrate from land to land and typically consist of roughly a thousand people. As the various tribes of Musafir still harbor some small amounts of distrust against one another, no more than a single tribe, a single group of Travelers, will move from nor settle in a particular land at the same time.

Unlike the Travelers, the Traveler Caravans will also disassemble and pick up any presently located building into building blocks to be carried off with the caravan on numerous beasts of burden. Though such an undertaking requires many camels and is expensive, it is also often worth it. Traveler Caravans cannot be recruited in the City of Musafir for none would allow such an act."

#descr "The people of Musafir place great emphasis on the afterlife and regard the dead with great reverence. All those who die are burned and their ashes scattered across the planes of the dead, those of the harsh, sandy deserts of Musafir. The people of Musafir believe that they constantly travel between the two lands, of Life and Death, for if one stops and stays in the lifeless desert for too long, only Death will greet him. When a tribe perishes in the desert, it is often believed that they strayed too far in the lands of the dead and were claimed by them. The fact that such tribes are often laid to rest by Spirit Guides reinforces the belief.
It is the Spirit Guides that tend to the funerary rites of the people of Musafir. As the unyielding deserts of Musafir are considered holy and not of this world, only the Spirit Guides are allowed to spread the ashes of the decently cremated. Even though their role in the tribal society of Musafir is essential, the burden of these spiritualists lies in being ostracized from the tribes, for men who stand between the two worlds belong to neither of them. Spirit Guides are only sought out to perform cremations and to carry the ashes to the spirit world."#ap 12

It is said that these mystics can gaze into the desert flames and see great things yet to come. Much of their time is spent gazing into the flames of future. As they often live out as hermits; sequestered in the Harsh Sands of Musaifr, far from any tribal intrigue or politics, they do not hold as much priestly powers as the Soothsayers do. In times of great calamity and turbulence the Farseers will venture back into the tribes of Musafir and deliver the prophecies seen in the desert flames. Though the Farseers are known for their reclusive lifestyle, they do not always life alone. Often, traveling tribes that stray too close to a Farseers home will find themselves watched by the giant Golden Scorpions, implying that these mystics possess more power than they lead on to have. With the coming of the new Lord of the Harsh Sands, the Farseers have abandoned their hermitage and have started banding under a loose and scattered tribe of their own. Many now choose to serve these holy mystics that are foretelling the new dawn of Musafir under the Lord of the Harsh Sands."#ap 12

#descr "With the rise of the new God of the Harsh Sands, the borders of Musafir are constantly expanding. As such, numerous new and bountiful lands are opened up to the Travelers. With the blessing of their new god, many tribes, both small and large, take this opportunity to settle in these new and strange lands, and expand Musafir's influence. In the sacred City of Musafir, the biggest and oldest oasis in the harsh desert, many caravans are formed and then sent to claim distant lands and erect new Musafir settlements in the name of the Lord of the Harsh Sands. The numerous tribes constantly vie for power and the privilege to settle these rich lands, and as such whose caravan gets sent is heavily politically influenced as only one of the four major tribes is allowed to settle in any single land.  

This Farseer Caravan is in the process of settling in the current land."

#descr "As the tribes of Musafir spread beyond the deserts of Sharthalor and trade routes expanded, enterprising merchants banded together, pooling resources and knowledge to dominate the burgeoning spice trade. Over generations, their influence grew, and the wealth they amassed transformed humble caravans into sprawling trade networks. Their families rose to prominence, becoming powerful dynasties vying for supremacy in markets across the world.
To maintain order among themselves and secure Musafir’s dominance in commerce, they established the Merchant Guild, an institution that set the rules of trade and resolved disputes. Within this guild, the most powerful and successful merchants rose to the esteemed rank of Spice Lords.
The merchants of Musafir are united by a shared purpose but often divided by fierce rivalries. Each Spice Lord represents a faction within the Guild, a coalition of merchants whose fortunes hinge on their leader’s vision and ability to forge lucrative deals and outmaneuver competitors."

#descr "Many secrets and wondrous treasures lie buried beneath the desert dunes, hidden beneath the ever-shifting sands. Vast cities of old, once magnificent centers of knowledge and innovation now turned into tombs, their ruins consumed by time and suffocating dunes. 
The Sand Wraiths are the forsaken remnants of Sharthalor’s ancient guards, bound by unyielding magic to protect the now fallen empire. Even in death, their vigil endures. So ancient are they that only their restless spirits remain now, their bones having long since crumbled to dust, their bodies now composed of swirling desert sands. Sand Wraiths are nearly impossible to harm, their forms flowing like desert storms, dissipating under physical attacks and reforming moments later. To disturb the sunken cities they guard is to awaken a wrath as eternal as the desert."

#descr "Deep in the harsh and unforgiving deserts of Sharthalor, in the Dead Wastes believed to be the plane of the dead, where no life exists, raging whirlwinds called Sand Devils may be found. These manifestations of the primordial magic that runs through the harsh sand are sacred to many people of the desert who believe them to be the restless spirits of the deceased. While most Sand Devils are relatively small and fleeting, some have been known to grow to truly terrifying proportions. These colossal whirlwinds can carve deep scars into the landscape, their howling winds echoing with the voices of those who perished in the desert’s relentless grip. For the people of Sharthalor, encountering a Sand Devil is both a moment of awe and dread, for these elemental forces are as unpredictable as the desert itself, and their wrath is not easily appeased."

#descr "In the most secluded parts of the scorching deserts of Sharthalor lives something dangerous and ancient, where even the most terrifying monsters dare not venture and disturb its domain. This entity is known as the Beholder. Old as the gods and just as powerful, this ancient and malicious being kills its victim with a mere gaze of its huge and horrifying eye. In its many millennia the Beholder has been able to gaze into the infinite darkness and unravel the Astral Sphere, perceiving beyond the borders of the mortal realm and attaining powers unimaginable. Its eyes are all-seeing and nothing can hide from their gaze, not even the future."

#descr "A mysterious creature of long forgotten times, the Sphinx is a master of secrets and riddles. It appears as a blend of a muscular and regal lion and a wise human. Its face, often serene yet piercing, reflects an ancient wisdom, framed by a mane-like cascade of hair or, at times, a regal headdress. Its eyes seem to peer into the very soul, weighing intentions with divine judgment. The Sphinx is steeped in mystery and riddles, its presence a test of wit and will. It guards sacred places, treasures, or ancient knowledge, offering passage only to those who can match its cunning through wit and wisdom. Those who fail will find their minds dominated and enslaved by the Sphinx’s inscrutable power."

They appear as mesmerizing beings of impossible beauty, with wings of dancing flame, flowing hair woven from cool desert winds, and a body of intertwined lightning and flames. Ancient Sylphs are so striking in appearance that no sane mortal being would ever even dream of striking one down. Curious by nature, and somewhat whimsical, these spirits sometimes interact with the travelers of Musafir, whom they often observe in passing. Ancient Sylphs are almost immortal and can live for millennia. They are considered sacred to all the tribes of Musafir and are revered across the desert."

#descr "In Sharthalor, the scorching sun isn't the only radiant force on the horizon. The giant scarab beetles, with their amber carapaces, often appear as twin suns, absorbing the light and reflecting it with a brilliance that confounds travelers. Their carapaces - forged by the relentless heat and ancient magic of the desert which has allowed them to grow to such proportions - are tough to crack and highly resistant to flames. These beetles possess massive, serrated pincers that can crush stone and bone with terrifying ease, effortlessly shearing through even the hardest armor. Revered by some desert tribes, the scarab beetle is considered sacred by some of the inhabitants of Sharthalor."

#spr1 "./Confluence/EA_Musafir/SandDevilPretender1.tga"
#spr2 "./Confluence/EA_Musafir/SandDevilPretender2.tga"
#descr "Unlike the fleeting whirlwinds that dance across the Dead Wastes, the Fury of the Sands is an eternal maelstrom of golden sand and searing winds that pierce the heavens with its wrath. Its presence is a tempest of chaos, reshaping dunes into mountains and carving valleys where none existed, leaving behind scars that persist for centuries. Swirling at its base and spinning off from its tempestuous body, countless smaller Sand Devils spring into existence, as if the Fury's chaotic essence cannot be contained.
The desert tribes of Sharthalor believe the Fury is no mere spirit of the dead but the embodiment of an ancient god whose power was bound to the sands during the age of creation, whose howling winds are said to carry the voices of the long-forgotten dead. 
The Fury embodies the wrath of the land, punishing those who dare to disturb the balance of its sacred sands. Legends tell of those who have attempted to summon the Fury of the Sands through ancient rituals. Such endeavors always end in devastation, as the Fury heeds no mortal call but ever the desert itself. Only the most devout shamans claim to have glimpsed the heart of the storm, said to contain the essence of the ancient god and the spirits of those it has devoured over the eons.

The Fury of the Sands will continue to summon three Sand Devils of varying sizes each combat round, which will keep slowly fizzling out and disappearing."

#descr "The Hidden One is a mysterious and god-like being of the desert, cloaked in an aura of unfathomable power and invisible to the naked eye. Its arrival is marked by an oppressive stillness, where even the wind seems to falter in reverence. Those who draw near feel its unseen gaze piercing through them, though all they see are the endless, shifting dunes. 
Legends tell that The Hidden One is the keeper of forbidden knowledge, able to unravel the mysteries of existence and reveal truths that defy comprehension. Yet its gifts come at a terrible price. Mortals who seek its wisdom are said to leave its presence scarred, their minds frayed and shattered by the immensity of what they’ve learned. Some are driven to madness and hollowed, left to wander the deserts aimlessly, while others collapse under the sheer weight of these truths, their bodies claimed by the sands.
The Hidden One speaks in riddles and cryptic visions, testing the resolve and intellect of those who seek its counsel. Only the strongest of will can endure its revelations and retain even a fragment of their sanity, while the weak are consumed by the knowledge they so desperately sought."

#descr "The Dweller in the Sand is an ancient and colossal scarab beetle of godlike power, slumbering beneath the vast deserts of Sharthalor. Revered as a deity by desert tribes, it is said to be as old as the desert itself, predating even the rise and fall of the great cities now buried beneath the sands.
Legends tell of its immense form stirring beneath the dunes during times of great upheaval, its awakening heralded by tremors and storms of golden sand. Rarely seen and even more rarely understood, the Dweller is believed to guard ancient secrets and wield power capable of reshaping the desert and its fate. Tribes whisper that its occasional emergence is a sign of shifts in power or an omen of monumental change, as the Dweller rises only when the sands of fate shift."

#descr "The Keystone is a towering and weathered monolith, standing solitary amidst the Dead Wastes of Sharthalor. Its surface flows with vibrant colours - red and yellow crisscrossed with swirling blue patterns that seem to shimmer faintly under the oppressive sun. Though it appears lifeless at first glance, those who linger near it sense a dormant presence within, an ancient spirit said to be as old as the sands themselves.
Legends claim the Keystone was created by a council of three archmages - masters of Air, Death, and Fire - who sought to seal their knowledge and power within the stone, so that one day their power could be used to restore what was lost and buried beneath the sands. Pilgrims from across Sharthalor seek the Keystone for its rumoured power and knowledge, but few ever reach it, for the journey through the Dead Wastes is treacherous.  

The Keystone has an equal to dominion value change to empower a mage:
• Air 1 or Air 2 mage by +1, 
• Fire 1 or Fire 2 mage by +1, 
• Death 1 or Death 2 mage by +1.
Each of the three rolls are separate, require the Keystone to be present, and are rolled once per month."

#descr "These recluses who often dwell alone in the vast and unforgiving deserts are mystics said to possess an uncanny ability to foresee the future using the ever-shifting sands as their medium. They claim that each grain of sand holds a fragment of destiny -past, present, or future. According to folklore, Amathomancers wander the desert endlessly, sifting through every grain of sand in Sharthalor until they unravel every secret, and know all that ever was, is and will be.
These hermits are revered among all the desert tribes and frequently sought out by those who would know their destiny, only to realize it is to die amid the endless dunes. Those who do find them are often left with cryptic prophecies of things hidden in sand, or fantastical tales of forgotten empires that seem too extraordinary to have ever existed.
Their art is as much a curse as it is a gift. The visions they see in the swirling sands often carry the weight of inevitability, and the isolation they embrace only deepens the mystique of their craft."

#name "Musafir"
#epithet "The Wandering Tribes"
#era 1
#descr "Musafir is a vast desert plain where numerous, small and spread-out nomadic tribes dwell, continuously migrating from oasis to oasis and vying for control with other tribes over the few precious resources the desert has to offer. A recent shift in politics, brought on by numerous prophetic visions from Soothsayers and now returning Farseers alike, has ended the tribal conflicts and given rise to the uniting of the desert tribes under the leadership of the new god of the Harsh Sands. Musafir now stands as a nation of loosely-tied tribes. The centuries-long practice of enslaving other tribes has mostly ended but slavery still exists, possibly stronger than ever. The enslavement of the traveler tribes has been substituted for the mass enslavement of the newly-discovered Tigrans, a race of ferocious but primitive intelligent tigers, and other nations.
The tribes of Musafir have long since accustomed themselves to a life of a traveler. Indeed, their very name – Musafir - means one who travels. They are used to never settling for long in one place and have even developed ways of migrating entire settlements. Though the forts they build are often small and primitive - a reality of the harsh life in the desert, their simplicity makes it possible for them to carry the building blocks using numerous beasts of burden and setting them up elsewhere. The nomadic nature of the Musafir tribes and their distant travels have also given rise to a unique new opportunity, a rich new market of spice trading. Merchants laden with spices travel from one land to another, selling exotic spices for a hefty profit.
Over their long years and numerous leagues, the people of Musafir have become master traders and skilled diplomats. As such it is little wonder that they are able to negotiate extremely favorable deals and contract mercenary companies cheaper than usual."
#summary "Race: Humans. Prefer Heat scale +1.  Can migrate entire settlements with all accompanying buildings, including forts, to other lands. Can send trade caravans to friendly cities and even other nations for profit. Mercenaries cost 10 percent less. Nation starts with an extra 200 gold and an Envoy. 
Military: Light infantry, light cavalry, archers. Sacred Guardians of the Oasis. Various types of caravans.
Magic: Fire, Air, Astral, some Death.
Priests: Moderate."
#brief "Musafir is a nation of loosely-banded desert-dwelling nomadic tribes."

Over time they became as proficient swordsmen as those of any realm.

Nowadays, the Knights Arcane are formidable adversaries and few would dare to go toe to toe with them for even when outnumbered the Knights Arcane easily carry the day by using their magical abilities to level the playing field and immobilize a large part of the enemy force while fighting the other. Though the sacrifice the Knights Arcane made long ago was one of the main reasons the people of Edranor survived their persecution, little gratitude is shown to them today, for their lack of skill in wielding magic is considered an affront to the ideals of the society.

#descr "The Spellbinders belong to the ranks of the Venari, though their status is far from enviable. In a society where powers used to directly dominate others are respected above all, it is no wonder the Spellbinders are considered the lowest among the Venari, their abilities often considered little more than cheap parlor tricks, incapable of directly causing harm and devastation. However, this perception belies the insidious power they wield and the deadly outcomes their magic often achieves. Though the Spellbinders lack the raw force to kill outright, they are capable of projecting powerful illusions and clouding the minds of their enemies, making them believe that an enemy soldier stands where but a second ago a friend stood, a trick that typically ends up disrupting and thinning enemy lines. The Spellbinders are the only ones of the ranks of the Venari that have remained true to their original purpose and name, a fact mildly ironic given that the ones who have remained true to their name have lost it in the process."

#descr "Many of those who survive the Harrowing believe that the Possessed steal much more from their demonic manifestations than just their powers; perhaps their corrupted souls as well. For this reason, these mages are widely rumored to be more demon in nature than human after the completion of the trial. There are even those who think the Possessed indeed are demons, those that devoured the mages’ souls during the Harrowing and somehow found a link back to their corporeal bodies. Whatever the case may be, the Possessed truly do wield frightening demonic-like powers. Their abilities are grounded in Blood magic and vampirism, allowing them to unleash bolts of pure agony at their enemies that either leave them dead instantly or teetering on the brink of death.
The Possessed thrive on the anguish of others, drawing strength from the screams and agony of those they slay. This dark power allows them to leech the life force of others to replenish their own vitality and even open gashing cuts upon scores of enemies at once through sheer willpower and hatred. 
When gravely injured and on the brink of death, the Possessed enter a blood frenzy, their flowing wounds now used to amplify their magical abilities. There are many frightening tales of the Possessed suffering numerous fatal injuries, only to tear apart their enemies in a frenzied outburst of power and emerge unscathed. Much like all mages of Edranor, the abilities of the Possessed are also fueled by physical strength, but it is their deep reservoir of hatred and vengeance that truly empowers them.

The strength of the Possessed will increase if their HP drops to 4 HP."

#descr "Many of those who survive the Harrowing believe that the Possessed steal much more from their demonic manifestations than just their powers; perhaps their corrupted souls as well. For this reason, these mages are widely rumored to be more demon in nature than human after the completion of the trial. There are even those who think the Possessed indeed are demons, those that devoured the mages’ souls during the Harrowing and somehow found a link back to their corporeal bodies. Whatever the case may be, the Possessed truly do wield frightening demonic-like powers. Their abilities are grounded in Blood magic and vampirism, allowing them to unleash bolts of pure agony at their enemies that either leave them dead instantly or teetering on the brink of death.
The Possessed thrive on the anguish of others, drawing strength from the screams and agony of those they slay. This dark power allows them to leech the life force of others to replenish their own vitality and even open gashing cuts upon scores of enemies at once through sheer willpower and hatred. 
When gravely injured and on the brink of death, the Possessed enter a blood frenzy, their flowing wounds now used to amplify their magical abilities. There are many frightening tales of the Possessed suffering numerous fatal injuries, only to tear apart their enemies in a frenzied outburst of power and emerge unscathed. Much like all mages of Edranor, the abilities of the Possessed are also fueled by physical strength, but it is their deep reservoir of hatred and vengeance that truly empowers them.

The strength of the Possessed will increase if their HP drops to 4 HP."

#descr "Wisps are magical constructs created from, or perhaps fueled by the soul embers of those given to the purging flames of the Altus. The mages of Edranor can gaze through these magical constructs and primarily use them to spy on distant lands. The Wisps can open tiny dimensional rifts and instantaneously transport themselves to any place in the world. However, doing so will immediately burn out the Wisp, but not before the mages of Edranor have a change to glimpse potentially critical information.
Wisps will sometimes appear in places where justice, or rather retribution has been carried out by the Altus. As such, these soul embers will occasionally appear near activated Blood Obelisks where those deserving of punishment were given to the purging flames and their agonizing screams used to power the great obelisks. 

Wisps have a five percent chance of spawning each month per friendly dominion candle in any provinces where Blood Obelisks are activated."

This great spire was created by the Dreamers long ago, while still trying to rediscover the long-lost secret of Ascension in an effort to prevent the remaining people of Edranor from annihilation. It is while searching for this arcane secret that the Dreamers inadvertently uncovered the Dreamlands, a transcendental plane of existence. Now, the Dreamers devote all their waking hours in the Void Chamber, leaving the physical world behind. As a result, their numbers steadily dwindle, for they show little interest in anything apart from exploring the Dreamlands. The physical bodies of the Dreamers have become too weak to even leave the Void Chamber after suffering prolonged bouts of Dreamwalking and years of neglect from their owners. Many of those who return from the Dreamlands often find their frail and abandoned bodies pilled with ever more afflictions and neglect.
While navigating the Dreamlands, the Dreamers remain completely invisible until they manifest to forcibly pull their victims from their dreams into the Dreamlands with them. However, spending too much time in the Dreamlands can be very dangerous, as the realm itself is a living place that senses and reacts to intruders, attracting unwanted attention. Dreamers are rare and often viewed as mad by their peers in Edranor.

Among these closely guarded secrets, perhaps the most profound one pertains to the Harrowing. The Venari hold the secret of the Storm Infusion, a spell that empowers those that would attempt the Harrowing, making it easier for them to overcome the demons and join the ranks of the Venari.
However, this secret is seldom put to use, as revealing it to potential candidates carries significant risks, as well as significant resources not easily attainable. For those who undergo the Storm Infusion, the rewards are extraordinary. They find it much easier to master magic, and quickly become proficient spellcasters both in combat and in ritualistic spellcasting."

#descr "Mages are inherently secretive, and it is little wonder that many groups and individuals safeguard their share of arcane knowledge, from minor mysteries to profound truths. Among these closely guarded secrets, perhaps the most profound one pertains to the Harrowing. The Altus hold the secret of the Bleeding Fire, a spell that empowers those that would attempt the Harrowing, making it easier for them to overcome the demons and join the ranks of the Altus.
However, this secret is seldom put to use, as revealing it to potential candidates carries significant risks, as well as significant resources not easily attainable. For those who undergo the Bleeding Fire, the rewards are extraordinary. They find it much easier to master magic, and quickly become proficient spellcasters both in combat and in ritualistic spellcasting."

#name "Avatar of Vengeance"
#descr "When the Dreamers failed to rediscover the means of ascension, all hope for leading the people of Edranor from the brink of ruin was lost. In a last act of defiance, the people of Edranor turned away from ascension and escape for good and settled for vengeance. In a grand and bloody ritual, which would later be known as the very first Harrowing, the mages of Edranor invaded the Demon Realms, and acquired the means of vengeance. Most of those who attempted the first Harrowing died either in the crossing, or while facing the demonic spirits, but the few survivors who made it back acquired incredible demonic powers and became the very avatars of vengeance and retribution. It is by unleashing their unadulterated fury and rage that the people of Edranor found their salvation for the second time in history. Ever since, the Harrowing has become a coming-of-power ritual all mages undergo at one point or other. Though it was never made mandatory, it is unheard of for someone not to attempt it, for the price of power is well known and gladly paid. Avatars of Vengeance are the ones who know it best and who have paid the heaviest price. The vast and mysterious powers of the Avatars of Vengeance are a closely held secret. In truth, the Avatars are not fully human. Not all emerge from the Harrowing equally. Some mages are faced with lesser demons of limited powers, and some are faced with greater ones. Some are even plunged so deep into the Demon Realm that they lose all hope of returning to their corporeal bodies in time, regardless of the powers acquired. And then there are those that would become the Avatars of Vengeance, the mages who would not only take the vanquished demon's power and strength, but also devour its heart, absorbing the demon within themselves and thus gaining powers not akin to most. When an Avatar of Vengeance emerges from the Harrowing, she is watched very closely for many weeks and executed if the tiniest influence of the demon within is detected."

#name "Warden of the Bloodspring" -- 
#descr "Long before the magisterium rose to power, the ancient tunnels beneath Edranor were whispered to be cursed. Mages who delved too deeply into their winding depths often vanished, their disappearance blamed on maleficar practicing forbidden arts. As time passed, the stories evolved to tell of a sinister force beckoning inexperienced initiates with promises of power.
The Warden of the Bloodspring is the physical manifestation of the Bloodspring. Created from the souls of those given to its crimson depths, it exists as a living extension of the Bloodspring’s will. Its form rises from the surface of the pool, a humanoid figure composed entirely of blood, constantly shifting and rippling as if the substance of its body never truly settles. Faint impressions of faces and limbs surface within its fluid mass - remnants of the countless souls consumed by the Bloodspring over the centuries - before dissolving back into its crimson flow. Created by ancient Edranorian magisters during the founding of the magisterium, the Warden acts as a guardian, ensuring the Bloodspring’s power remains undisturbed. In reality, there is little distinction between the Bloodspring and its Warden, for they are one and the same.

The Warden of the Bloodspring will reduce unrest by 10 when in any land where blood-hunting is conducted in friendly dominion."

To create a Blood Echo is one such forbidden practice. These creations are twisted manifestation of life stripped to its core essence. All blood is drawn from a person, leaving behind a humanoid figure composed entirely of their own blood. Still alive, in a manner of speaking, this crimson echo retains the consciousness, memories, and will of its former self, but its physical form is fluid and unstable, a malleable mass of their own blood shifting and rippling like the ceaseless waves of a storm-tossed sea. Blood Echoes are bound to their creator’s will, and are exceptionally dangerous, able to shift and reshape at will, slip through cracks, and enter otherwise inaccessible areas."

By killing and then merging the Traces of Shadow of numerous creatures in certain places that are infused with Death and thus touch the borders of the Shadowlands, an Andrak can be created. Though such a ritual can be taught to and performed by any Death mage, it is rarely done so due to the necessary requirements and the volatile nature of the creatures which are near uncontrollable. The scent of gore in which it was born will drive the young and inexperienced Andrak insane with bloodlust and it will assuredly kill the mage which created it as well as all those who might still be alive after the ritual has been performed before it can be brought to heel. Though the Andrak are near uncontrollable they can still be directed by carefully crafted lies. The more one lies to the Andrak and the grandeur and more convincing the lies are the more likely the Andrak are to heed them.
The Andrak are creatures composed of pure shadow and as such mundane weapons are completely incapable of hurting them as are many types of magic.

#descr "The Manifestation is a demonic spirit unleashed from its prison, the body of an Avatar of Vengeance, through one last act of sacrifice. Now finally free in the Terrestrial Sphere, the envious Manifestation will continue to emulate its former keeper, adopting her mannerisms and traits, longing to become her. The difference between the demon and the Avatar is often negligible, particularly given the violent nature shared by both the Avatars and their demonic inhabitants. This unsettling truth, one that is rarely acknowledged, is the main reason the Harrowing rituals by the Avatars are a closely guarded secretsecrets that, if revealed, could threaten to tear Edranor apart. As the Avatars of Vengeance were no simple mages during their life, but mages that embodies the concept of Vengeance, and made it core to their identity, so will the Manifestation adopt that same mantle, becoming the vengeful demonic spirit of Edranor. Manifestations are capable of entering a blood frenzy, and the closer they are to death the more dangerous and powerful they become."

Now finally free in the Terrestrial Sphere, the envious Manifestation will continue to emulate its former keeper, adopting her mannerisms and traits, longing to become her. The difference between the demon and the Avatar is often negligible, particularly given the violent nature shared by both the Avatars and their demonic inhabitants. This unsettling truth, one that is rarely acknowledged, is the main reason the Harrowing rituals by the Avatars are a closely guarded secretsecrets that, if revealed, could threaten to tear Edranor apart. As the Avatars of Vengeance were no simple mages during their life, but mages that embodies the concept of Vengeance, and made it core to their identity, so will the Manifestation adopt that same mantle, becoming the vengeful demonic spirit of Edranor. Manifestations are capable of entering a blood frenzy, and the closer they are to death the more dangerous and powerful they become."

Whatever the case may be, the Possessed truly do wield frightening demonic-like powers. Their abilities are grounded in Blood magic and vampirism, allowing them to unleash bolts of pure agony at their enemies that either leave them dead instantly or teetering on the brink of death.
The Possessed thrive on the anguish of others, drawing strength from the screams and agony of those they slay. This dark power allows them to leech the life force of others to replenish their own vitality and even open gashing cuts upon scores of enemies at once through sheer willpower and hatred. 
When gravely injured and on the brink of death, the Possessed enter a blood frenzy, their flowing wounds now used to amplify their magical abilities. There are many frightening tales of the Possessed suffering numerous fatal injuries, only to tear apart their enemies in a frenzied outburst of power and emerge unscathed. Much like all mages of Edranor, the abilities of the Possessed are also fueled by physical strength, but it is their deep reservoir of hatred and vengeance that truly empowers them.

#descr "When the Dreamers failed to rediscover the means of ascension, all hope for leading the people of Edranor from the brink of ruin was lost. In a last act of defiance, the people of Edranor turned away from ascension and escape for good and settled for vengeance. In a grand and bloody ritual, which would later be known as the very first Harrowing, the mages of Edranor invaded the Demon Realms, and acquired the means of vengeance. Most of those who attempted the first Harrowing died either in the crossing, or while facing the demonic spirits, but the few survivors who made it back acquired incredible demonic powers and became the very avatars of vengeance and retribution. It is by unleashing their unadulterated fury and rage that the people of Edranor found their salvation for the second time in history. Ever since, the Harrowing has become a coming-of-power ritual all mages undergo at one point or other. Though it was never made mandatory, it is unheard of for someone not to attempt it, for the price of power is well known and gladly paid. Avatars of Vengeance are the ones who know it best and who have paid the heaviest price. The vast and mysterious powers of the Avatars of Vengeance are a closely held secret. In truth, the Avatars are not fully human. Not all emerge from the Harrowing equally. Some mages are faced with lesser demons of limited powers, and some are faced with greater ones. Some are even plunged so deep into the Demon Realm that they lose all hope of returning to their corporeal bodies in time, regardless of the powers acquired. And then there are those that would become the Avatars of Vengeance, the mages who would not only take the vanquished demon's power and strength, but also devour its heart, absorbing the demon within themselves and thus gaining powers not akin to most. When an Avatar of Vengeance emerges from the Harrowing, she is watched very closely for many weeks and executed if the tiniest influence of the demon within is detected."

#descr "A new, secretive order of mages has formed in Edranor - the Venerate. Forsaking blood magic and vengeance that has defined their kin for so long, these mages have turned to necromancy for salvation instead.
The Venerate are driven by the grim conviction that Edranor is already lost, with no hope of saving it, but only surviving its downfall. They know that the magisterium is corrupted by demonic influence down to its foundation, and that demons have seeped into every corner of society. To the Venerate, Edranor’s fall is not only inevitable but imminent.
In their search for survival, the Venerate have come to the realization that demonic entities can only possess the living – whose corruptible souls provide entry - or the dead – empty vessels that can be animated by demonic spirits. The undead, however, are immune to demonic influence, their half-dead state an unassailable barrier. By turning themselves into this state, the Venerate shield themselves from possession. Few in number, their existence is contingent on secrecy to avoid the ire of the magisterium and discovery by the possesesed. They harbor no illusions of saving Edranor, focusing instead on surviving its destruction, and gathering what power and knowledge they can in preparation for the dark days to come. Hidden within labyrinthine catacombs and forgotten ruins, the Venerate weave their necromantic arts, crafting an unholy refuge against the chaos that they believe is coming."

#name "Cross the Border"
#descr "During their research into other realms of existence and means of preserving themselves, the Venerate have discovered the Shadowlands. In places marked by an overwhelming presence of death, the veil between the mortal realm and the Shadowlands wears thin. These liminal sites, scarred by overwhelming tragedy and steeped in the aftermath of countless deaths, become ideal sites to create an Andrak where the darker parts of one’s soul may be harvested. 
To create an Andrak, a necromancer orchestrates the mass, ritualistic slaughter of living beings at the site. As their deaths saturate the location with fresh Traces of Shadow - the darker parts of one's soul - they are woven together to form the Andrak, a monstrous amalgamation of darkness and hate."
#details "Creates 'Shadowlands' site. For the spell to work, the province must have at minimum a Death 2 scale. Should Death scales ever fall under Death 2, the site will vanish.

In places marked by an overwhelming presence of death, the veil between the mortal realm and the Shadowlands wears thin. These liminal sites, scarred by overwhelming tragedy and steeped in the aftermath of countless deaths, become ideal sites to create an Andrak where the darker parts of one’s soul may be harvested. 
To create an Andrak, a necromancer orchestrates the mass, ritualistic slaughter of living beings at the site. As their deaths saturate the location with fresh Traces of Shadow - the darker parts of one's soul - they are woven together to form the Andrak, a monstrous amalgamation of darkness and hate."

This ritual creates a complex enchantment that mirrors any injury inflicted upon the mage back upon the attacker. While the enchantment does not prevent the mage from being harmed, it acts as a powerful deterrent to those who would dare to strike at an Edranorian, as doing so may lead to dire consequences. The knowledge and skill required to perform this ritual are only possessed by those tainted by demonic powers, making it a rare ability."

Within the Dreamlands, the Dreamer may traverse impossible distances instantaneously and drag unsuspecting victims into the Dream realm in an attempt to kill them. Dreamers wield strange arcane knowledge and are able to safely traverse the Dreamlands. 
Should they die in the Dreamlands they will simply awaken in the Void Chamber, ready to delve into the dreams once again. However, exploring the Dreamlands is fraught with peril, as it inevitably draws unwanted attention from the realm's otherworldly inhabitants, some of whom may pursue the Dreamer back into the Terrestrial Sphere.
Dreamers cannot linger in the Dreamlands indefinitely; their astral forms gradually deteriorate, losing cohesion over time, until they are expelled from the Dreamlands altogether."
#details "Transforms the casting Dreamer into an astral form, capable of instantaneous travel across the world. While in this shape the Dreamer will lose 30% of his max HP each turn until he eventually dies, at which point he will reassume his original form.

#newspell
#name "The Harrowing"
#descr "The Harrowing is a perilous ritual in which an Initiate's spirit is projected into the Demon Realm for a brief but harrowing encounter with a demonic entity. Even though demons can take many different forms in their own realm, driven by jealousy and envy of humans, they will adopt the form of the mage they seek to devour, hoping to usurp their place in the Terrestrial Sphere. Once faced with the demon, the Initiate will attempt to kill the fiend and take its powers for their own, merging the essence of the demon with that of themselves, or die trying. Those who undergo the Harrowing are first forced to relive the most tragic and painful events of their life, a tormenting reminder of the suffering endured and the reasons driving them to undertake the ritual. The Harrowing is notoriously dangerous, with most who attempt it perishing despite years of preparation, leaving behind but an empty husk, splayed across the floors of the Blood Spire. However, those who survive emerge from the ritual empowered, their newfound demonic power fueling a deep, unyielding hatred for outsiders. The Harrowing can be undergone but once, for any mage who tries to attempt it a second time will either die outright or find themselves permanently stuck in the Demon Realm, unable to return to their corporeal bodies in the Terrestrial Sphere. 
The duty of initiating the Harrowing falls to the Avatars of Vengeance as well as the responsibility of slaying the enslaved forms of those Initiates who fail it, and end up possessed. The Harrowing is traditionally performed only once a month, and no more than one Initiate may undergo it."
#details "An Avatar of Vengeance must cast this ritual. Only those initiates with 12 or more experience points are eligible to undergo it. To select the Initiate meant to take the Harrowing choose one that has already been promoted and change shape into a form which lack item slots.

Any Initiate who undergoes the Harrowing will have a 40 % chance to transform into an Altus Arcane, 40 % chance to transform into a Venari Arcane, and 20 % chance to transform into an Avatar of Vengeance.

This ritual can be cast only once per turn, and no more than a single Initiate will be able to undergo it. Edranor must be in full control of the province for the ritual to have effect.

Those who undergo the Harrowing will be put in a mirror duel and will face the form they transform into in battle."

It manifests as a swirling mass of ever-shifting tentacles adorned with clusters of glowing orbs that emit hypnotic pulses of light. These lights shift through an endless spectrum of colors, each more captivating than the last, enthralling those who gaze upon them, and drawing their consciousnesses into its orbs, their essence forever trapped and added to the Luminarch's eerie brilliance. 
Long ago, Edranorian magisters once unintentionally summoned the Luminarch as a side effect of a ritual to conjure pure light. Instead, a being composed entirely out of light appeared.
They attempted to bind it with spells and wards, but their efforts were futile. The creature, unbound by the laws of physical existence, slipped through barriers as effortlessly as light passing through glass. The entire city vanished overnight, its inhabitants consumed by the lights. All that remained were smooth, multicolored glasslike plains where the streets and buildings once stood."

#descr "The Corrupted Magister was once a powerful mage, occupying one of the highest positions in Edranor’s magisterium, whose body and soul have been consumed by a demonic entity. Once an esteemed master of arcane arts, ambition led him to tamper with dangerous magic, opening the path for possession. 
Now, the magister is an unholy fusion of a mortal and a demon, wielding magic warped by infernal corruption. The Corrupted Magister’s physical form bears the marks of its torment and transformation. His flesh is pallid and stretched thin, barely sufficient to contain the demonic essence writhing within. Four claw-like arms extend unnaturally from its torso, each tipped with jagged talons capable of tearing through steel and bone. The Magister’s blackened eyes burn with searing hatred and eldritch power, and its voice carries an unsettling resonance, as though two beings speak in dreadful harmony. 
The entity is a master of magic capable of performing intricate rituals and tearing the veil between realms. Despite its monstrous transformation, fragments of the original mage's mind linger, twisted and submerged beneath the demon's control."

For numerous years, the First Archon guided Edranor, elevating the magisterium to its vaunted position and leading the nation into an era of unparalleled magical advancement. Then, without a warning or a trace, he vanished. Rumors abounded in the wake of his disappearance; claims that he had perished while delving into forbidden magics, ascended to another realm, or was usurped by jealous magisters. As time passed, his fate became little more than the subject of legends, his story relegated to the history books and fanciful tales.
Now, centuries later, the Archon has reappeared, sparking awe and disquiet among Edranor’s magisters. While his appearance seems unchanged and his immense power remains, there is something unsettling in his presence which sparks unease."

#descr "The Gauntlet is a monolithic hand of stone, thrusting upward from the earth as though clawing free from an ancient burial site. Its immense fingers, each the size of towering spires, curl towards the heavens, frozen mid-reach. Its surface, weathered and blackened by ages of wind and sun, is veined with molten-like cracks that pulse brightly, as if the hand itself retains some dormant vitality. Surrounding the Gauntlet, a jagged chasm stretches like a wound in the earth, emanating whispers and guttural groans that seem to rise from an abyss far below.
In ages past, the lands around the Gauntlet were once fertile and thriving, home to a small kingdom ruled by a covetous monarch. Driven by greed and consumed by the desire for divine power, the ruler sought to summon a forgotten deity - a being of immense power imprisoned deep within the earth for crimes against creation itself. The ritual to awaken the deity demanded an unspeakable price, and when the monarch’s arrogance exceeded his wisdom, the summoning spiraled out of control. The ground ruptured, swallowing the kingdom in a cataclysmic quake, and from the devastation emerged the Gauntlet, a fragment of the deity’s form, clawing its way toward freedom before the ritual faltered and it was once more imprisoned.
Now, the Gauntlet serves as a warning and a temptation. The air around it is heavy with dread, and those who draw too close feel an overwhelming compulsion to kneel, as though the hand’s sheer presence crushes the will. Over centuries, numerous cults have arisen around it, hoping to complete the failed summoning. Yet, for all its terrible majesty, the Gauntlet remains a prison, one whose cracks grow slightly deeper with every passing year, threatening to unleash the Bound One's wrath upon the world once more.

The Gauntlet is capable of draining Magic scales worldwide in order to empower itself in all existing paths."

#descr "The Gauntlet is a monolithic hand of stone, thrusting upward from the earth as though clawing free from an ancient burial site. Its immense fingers, each the size of towering spires, curl towards the heavens, frozen mid-reach. Its surface, weathered and blackened by ages of wind and sun, is veined with molten-like cracks that pulse brightly, as if the hand itself retains some dormant vitality. Surrounding the Gauntlet, a jagged chasm stretches like a wound in the earth, emanating whispers and guttural groans that seem to rise from an abyss far below.
In ages past, the lands around the Gauntlet were once fertile and thriving, home to a small kingdom ruled by a covetous monarch. Driven by greed and consumed by the desire for divine power, the ruler sought to summon a forgotten deity - a being of immense power imprisoned deep within the earth for crimes against creation itself. The ritual to awaken the deity demanded an unspeakable price, and when the monarch’s arrogance exceeded his wisdom, the summoning spiraled out of control.

#name "Evil Eye"
#descr "In their pursuit of knowledge and arcane secrets, the mages of Edranor have delved into realms of magic that should have remained untouched. Their experiments and rituals, fueled by ambition and hubris, have drawn the attention of otherworldly powers which have taken a keen interest in them. 
Among these beings one entity stands apart in its fascination with Edranor, observing it continuedly with a detached curiosity. For centuries, it has watched the Edranorian magisterium, following their every move, studying them as they study the void, weaving its influence through the flow of magic itself, subtly nudging the Edranorians towards paths of forbidden knowledge. 
The Evil Eye is an eldritch being of immense power, appearing as a massive, unblinking eye shrouded in swirling crimson mist. The creature does not move conventionally, instead appearing to drift silently, its gaze always in search of something unknown. A crimson mist moves ceaselessly around it, churning like a living shroud, while the entity’s gaze, unfathomable and dispassionate, seems to pierce through the very fabric of reality, and is capable of instantly killing those it fixes upon."

#descr "The Blood Crystal is a massive crimson relic reminiscent of the arcane anchors of old, used to tame and stabilize Mana Vortexes before Edranorians fled Sharthalor. However, this creation far surpasses those ancient devices. Unlike the stabilizers of old, which merely tethered volatile energy, the Blood Crystal is the source of its own dreadful power, acting as a living vortex, drinking up not only the emotions of the Edranorians, but also the vitality of those in its surroundings, as well as the souls of those sacrificed to it.
Over the centuries, the Blood Crystal has syphoned so much emotions and life-force that it has become something beyond a mere magical anchor, and come to life. 
Its crimson depths are alive with the ghostly visages of the countless victims whose lives were consumed to create and maintain it. Faces press against the surface like trapped spirits, their expressions locked in silent screams of torment, while shadowy forms writhe within its core, as if the blood and life-force it absorbed continue to struggle against their fate.
Its continued absorption of Edranorian emotions - rooted in anger, and retribution - has begun to mold the Blood Crystal into a malevolent godlike entity. Gradually gaining sentience, it has started to manifest a will of its own, subtle but undeniable. Whispers emanate from its crystalline depths, promising great power and dominion to those who serve it.

The Blood Crystal will create an eponymous site wherever it is present which grants 10% Blood magic discount."

Its appearance is a grotesque amalgamation of shifting forms, its translucent, pulsating core radiating a light that casts colors unknown to this world. Writhing tentacles extend from its central mass, and an eerie hum, too low to hear yet impossible to ignore, burrows into the minds of those who draw near it. To witness it is to experience a fragment of the madness that festers beyond the boundaries of mortal reality.
Legends speak of the Octopod’s first emergence centuries ago, when the magisters of Edranor experimented by opening pathways into the Void in their pursuit of knowledge. What they discovered instead was this monstrous being. The Eldritch Octopod tore through the Veil, annihilating its summoners in moments, leaving only distorted echoes of their final cries reverberating in the chamber’s stone for years to come. The magisterium quickly erased records of the incident, but the tale persisted, whispered in the dark corners of Edranor. Ever since, even the most daring mages have been hesitant to probe into the Void too deeply, lest they draw its attention."

No matter how degrading or inhumane the command, those bound by the circlet are forced to comply or face unrelenting suffering. The Circlet of Anguish is used by the Edranorians as a tool of subjugation and a means of control, much akin to the ancient collars of Musafir which once bound their ancestors."

#descr "Religions hold no sway in Edranor, and as such temples, prophets, priests and the like have no influence. The only thing the mages of Edranor believe in is power, and more recently, vengeance. The mage-folk of Edranor spread their dominion over the lands not through faith, but by dominating others, cowing their enemies into submission through great fear of reprisals and displays of their god-like powers. There is no mistaking the borders of Edranor, for every corner of their land is marked by the imposing and numerous Blood Obelisks which act as temples in their own right. They are the instruments through which Edranor spreads dominion over the lands, and by performing sadistic and unspeakable rituals the Blood Obelisks can be made to pulsate with a dark, blood-red colour and hum with the agonizing screams of all those the mages of Edranor have taken vengeance upon. Though the mages of Edranor are no crueler than needed when the situation arises, they are also completely without compassion and indiscriminate in their judgement. They will not hesitate to slaughter a whole city if they have been wronged in some perceived manner, but will not turn their anger to those undeserving of it. 

As a result of their torment-riddled history, the mages of Edranor have become extremely xenophobic. Roughly one percent of population will be killed each month in every land owned by Edranor where hostile dominion still holds sway until the local population is fully pacified. The hostile dominion will be reduced at a rate of on average one candle per three months, though it will not automatically turn to friendly on its own. Once there is no more hostile dominion in a province, it will be considered pacified, and the killings will stop."

--The Healing Blood is the source of power of the Healing Church. 
--It is capable of purging all afflictions to those it is administered 
--to and is the reason why so many outsides come to the Healing Church for 
--its miraculous cure. However, those who receive the Healing Blood experience 
--vivid hallucinations of a bloody beast crawling towards them, something discarded 
--as a bad dream by those of the Healing Church who administer the blood. It is around 
--the same time that the scourge of the beast first appeared when administration of the 
--Healing Blood became widespread. Those to whom the blood was administered slowly started 
--turning into monstrous beasts. Growing in size and becoming mad and delusional these beastly 
--men would roam and streets killing those not yet infected. Though the Healing Church was well 
--aware of the side effects of their blood ministration, outsides were blamed for the spreading 
--of the beastly plague.

#descr "While Dreamers have little interest in the physical world, they are still shackled to their physical forms while Dreamwalking and often suffer horrible afflictions from prolonged bouts of Dreamwalking and neglect of their bodies. The discovery of the Healing Blood - a mysterious substance of unknown origin - was thus embraced eagerly by the Dreamers. A single drop of the strange concoction instantly returns vitality, and continued consumption nullifies the withering effects of prolonged Dreamwalking, healing even the most severe afflictions. The true nature of the Healing Blood remains a closely guarded secret known only to the Dreamers, and few outside the Void Chamber are allowed it. Though the healing properties of the Healing Blood are undeniable, it also seems to cause a taint in those who indulge in it for any length of time."

#selectnation 313
#name "Edranor "
#epithet "Ten Thousand Spires"
#era 2
#descr "The might of Edranor was well-known across the desert. However, while their abilities were astounding, their numbers were few and slow to increase, unlike the slavers of Musafir, who multiplied and spread as quickly as weeds and proved just as hard to eradicate. Fearful of Edranor's rise to power, the tribes of Musafir united in a brutal attempt to eradicate their runaway slaves. Overwhelmed by relentless attacks and sheer numbers, the mages of Edranor were forced to concede their fledgling realm city by city, until they found themselves besieged in their great city of Edranor. In desperation, they attempted an ascension ritual to escape their inevitable deaths and the impending destruction of Edranor. While many succeeded in ascending and leaving their mortal coils behind, the ritual went disastrously awry, triggering a volcanic eruption which interrupted the ritual and consumed much of the city and besieging army. Those few who failed to ascend and were not consumed in the cataclysm, seized the chaos to flee into the desert. Many restless years they spent on the run, relentlessly hunted, their numbers dwindling until all hope for survival was quenched. It was then that the first Harrowing was undergone, and the means of salvation, and indeed retribution, discovered. Now, Edranor is a growing empire intent on collecting long-owed debts in blood. The powers of Edranorians are anchored in emotions, primarily those of hate, vengeance, and pain. As such female mages are more adept at wielding this particular brand of magic than males are, and hold the reins of society. 

Edranorians have learnt to pay a heavy toll for their powers and survival. Blood Hunting is tolerated more than in other lands. Their strife-filled history has made them exceptionally xenophobic for they continue to pacify locals until all foreign influence is removed. Roughly one percent of population will be killed each passing month and dominion reduced at a rate of one candle per three months."
#summary "Unrest is reduced by 5 points in friendly dominion while blood hunting. Dominion conflict bonus +1.
Military: Nation of mages who mostly use spells instead of conventional weapons. Troops use enchanted robes instead of armor.
Magic: Fire, Air, Astral, Glamour, Blood.
Priests: None. Preaching and temples have no effect. Dominion is spread by Blood Obelisks which are activated to spread dominion through spells.
God can be recalled by Blood Obelisks which have an equivalent recall god power of H1."
#brief "A nations of mages whose powers come from demonic sources and are fueled by vengeance. They do not use conventional weapons but spells, rather. The mages of Edranor are very powerful, though fewer in number than other human nations."

#name "Black Mirror"
#descr "The Black Mirror is a creation of master illusionists who delve into the darker, macabre arts of illusion and mirror crafting. This ominous mirror with a perfectly polished surface seems to absorb light rather than reflect it, with depths that appear endless, as if gazing into the void. When held, the mirror reflects any harm or malicious intent directed at its bearer. Those who attempt to strike, curse, or injure the holder will find their efforts turned against them, as though the mirror bends reality to shield its master. The mirror’s surface ripples only when an attack is deflected, and the more violent the assault, the more brutal the retaliation. Its unsettling presence hints at something trapped within, watching, waiting for its moment to turn the reflection against its own wielder."

#descr "A masterfully crafted ring, crafted at the hands of skilled illusionists who specialize in bending perception. Set with a flawless moonstone, its soft, ethereal glow pulses faintly in the dark. When worn, the ring grants its bearer the ability to vanish completely, turning them invisible to the naked eye. The magic woven into the ring cloaks not just the wearer’s body but also their presence, leaving no trace of sound or shadow behind. Crafted with precision by illusionists who understand the subtleties of deception, the ring’s power is seamless, allowing the wearer to slip through even the most watchful eyes, as if they never existed at all."

This elegant ring is crafted from a silver-like material that seems to shimmer between reality and illusion. When its magic is invoked, the ring calls forth warriors from the Dreamwild, warriors made of dreams, memories, and legends, armed with phantasmal weapons and clad in armor woven from gossamer threads. Though they are not real, they can interact with the physical world, fighting with ethereal grace while remaining nearly impervious to mundane weapons. However, as creatures of the Dreamwild, they are fleeting by nature, and will fade back into the Dreamwild once their battle is complete, leaving only the faintest echoes of their presence."

When held, the Dream Stone grants its bearer the uncanny ability to enter the dreams of others, slipping into their subconscious. Once inside, the wielder can manipulate the dreamer's visions, twisting and reshaping their dreams to create vivid, surreal landscapes or weave fantasies. With it, the bearer can seduce the dreamer's mind, planting suggestions and desires that linger long after the dream fades."

#name "Shroud of Concealment"  
#descr "A shroud of concealment is extended to the targeted individual who is cloaked with a primitive veil of invisibility, rendering them unseen to the naked eye. While the individual becomes visually imperceptible, the shroud affects only sight, leaving other senses like sound, smell, and touch unaffected. Footsteps may still be heard, scents linger, and the air may stir with their presence. It is a fleeting disguise, useful for quick evasion or stealth in plain sight, but careful movement is essential, as one misstep can betray the hidden."

#descr "Chromatic Orb is a dazzling and powerful spell, favored among illusionists who seek to distract their enemies with dazzling displays of magical energy. The caster summons a concentrated orb of brilliant and vibrant colors and unleashes it towards the enemy. As it hurtles through the air, it swirls with a mesmerizing array of hues and shades, distracting and disorienting those who look upon it. Upon impact, the orb explodes in a shower of shimmering light and color, which can be blinding to those who are caught in the blast. Those who are not killed outright by the spell will be left blinded or temporarily stunned and vulnerable to further attacks."

Though these restraints are purely illusional, they weigh heavily on the mind of those ensnared, causing them to feel the sensation of being bound. Victims often stumble, struggle, or freeze in place, believing they are truly trapped and immobilized. The spell does not physically restrain its targets, but the convincing nature of the illusion can immobilize or hinder even the most determined foe, as long as their mind succumbs to the deception."

Sinister and foreboding, the tower is chock full of eerie and horrifying imagery capable of turning the bravest hearts cold. Any Illusionist who combines the art of Illusionism with Death magic will quickly learn unsettling secrets and will be feared by many."

Under a regular barrage of deceptive magic, the tower undergoes metamorphosis daily, and at times, even hourly. Dawn may reveal it engulfed in flames only to vanish entirely at the stroke of noon, until one inadvertently collides with its unseen facade, nursing a bloodied nose. Living under the confusing glare of the Mirror Tower, the people of Iridia have long since mastered the art of turning a blind eye to the inexplicable happening around them. Rather than succumbing to perpetual dismay, they opt for nonchalance, a coping mechanism that has, unfortunately, lead to no small number of unfortunate events, such as fires being left to ravage the city unopposed, believed to be yet another in a long line of illusions to regularly disrupt the city. 
The impossible tower of illusions is guarded by the Mirror Guard, a contingent of elite soldiers enchanted to appear twelve feet tall through the art of Illusionism. Adapting to this magnifying enchantment takes some getting used to as Mirror Guards don't see themselves enlarged to gigantic proportions, but do see their fellows as such, creating all sorts of confusion among the ranks. Should the illusion be broken, the soldiers might possibly find themselves in a precarious situation, being spread too thinly. The Mirror Guard is equipped with enchanted mirror shields. Gleaming and flowing with strange colours, these strange shields will confuse onlookers during battle, projecting false images back at would-be attackers. Though a strong-willed warrior will stay focused through this trickery, those less mentally disciplined might quickly find themselves in disarray, swinging blindly at both friend and foe."

Due to their shape-shifting abilities, no one actually knows or can even speculate what a Phantasmagorian looks like. In fact, it likely doesn't even have a form but rather projects an illusion of one directly into its observer's mind, given that several people can look at the Phantasmagorian and argue about the vastly differing appearance of the horrifying being they're staring at. Living between worlds the Phantasmagorians have an unsettling ability to capture unwarded teleporting travelers and even dreamers within the Void and feed on their fears and emotions. The ability of the Masters Macabre to conjure equally horrifying images and delight in the fear they cause in others makes them closely associated with this monster and may explain why they have succeeded in befriending the creature. Though the Phantasmagorian is also a master of the macabre, it is itself a rather cowardly creature."

The vapors are then carefully blown through a long silver straw until a bubble forms at the tip. It is then left to dry in the reflection of the sun in 13 small concave silver mirrors. As the bubble is heated it will float upwards and out in the world."

Iridian Priests are preachers who openly glorify the Illusionists, whose magic has frequently protected and eased the lives of the locals. Though not mages themselves, Iridian Priests possess limited knowledge of Illusionism due to their close relationship with the Illusionists."

#descr "At the very top of the Mirror Tower lies a hidden vault where the most precious mirrors await, preserved under a thin veil of dust and cobwebs. Though few in number and many hundreds of years old, these mirrors represent the pinnacle of the art of Illusionism. Unlike Golden Mirrors, which hold amateurish and blurry semblances, or Silver Mirrors, which capture quite realistic but incomplete images, the mirrors in this vault contain images that are nearly perfect in every regard. The images held are so impeccable they even bleed when cut, and no amount of disbelief can dispel their existence. This raises the profound question: at what point does a copy become as real as the original? The only discernible difference between the monsters captured in these mirrors and their real counterparts is their lack of free will or perhaps a soul. A Macabre Mirror can contain countless images, with many Master Illusionists dedicating their entire lives to adding to their ever-growing collections. Most often, a Master Illusionist's achievements are concluded when a ritual goes awry, leading to their demise at the hands of the monster they were attempting to trap. Although Monstrous Mirrors often hold dozens or even hundreds of exotic creatures, only as many as the Illusionist dares to control are released when the mirror is activated."

#descr "At the very top of the Mirror Tower lies a hidden vault where the most precious mirrors await, preserved under a thin veil of dust and cobwebs. Though few in number and many hundreds of years old, these mirrors represent the pinnacle of the art of Illusionism. Unlike Golden Mirrors, which hold amateurish and blurry semblances, or Silver Mirrors, which capture quite realistic but incomplete images, the mirrors in this vault contain images that are nearly perfect in every regard. The images held are so impeccable they even bleed when cut, and no amount of disbelief can dispel their existence. This raises the profound question: at what point does a copy become as real as the original? The only discernible difference between the monsters captured in these mirrors and their real counterparts is their lack of free will or perhaps a soul. A Macabre Mirror can contain countless images, with many Master Illusionists dedicating their entire lives to adding to their ever-growing collections. Most often, a Master Illusionist's achievements are concluded when a ritual goes awry, leading to their demise at the hands of the monster they were attempting to trap. Although Monstrous Mirrors often hold dozens or even hundreds of exotic creatures, only as many as the Illusionist dares to control are released when the mirror is activated."

#descr "At the very top of the Mirror Tower lies a hidden vault where the most precious mirrors await, preserved under a thin veil of dust and cobwebs. Though few in number and many hundreds of years old, these mirrors represent the pinnacle of the art of Illusionism. Unlike Golden Mirrors, which hold amateurish and blurry semblances, or Silver Mirrors, which capture quite realistic but incomplete images, the mirrors in this vault contain images that are nearly perfect in every regard. The images held are so impeccable they even bleed when cut, and no amount of disbelief can dispel their existence. This raises the profound question: at what point does a copy become as real as the original? The only discernible difference between the monsters captured in these mirrors and their real counterparts is their lack of free will or perhaps a soul. A Macabre Mirror can contain countless images, with many Master Illusionists dedicating their entire lives to adding to their ever-growing collections. Most often, a Master Illusionist's achievements are concluded when a ritual goes awry, leading to their demise at the hands of the monster they were attempting to trap. Although Monstrous Mirrors often hold dozens or even hundreds of exotic creatures, only as many as the Illusionist dares to control are released when the mirror is activated."

Though few in number and many hundreds of years old, these mirrors represent the pinnacle of the art of Illusionism. Unlike Golden Mirrors, which hold amateurish and blurry semblances, or Silver Mirrors, which capture quite realistic but incomplete images, the mirrors in this vault contain images that are nearly perfect in every regard. The images held are so impeccable they even bleed when cut, and no amount of disbelief can dispel their existence. This raises the profound question: at what point does a copy become as real as the original? The only discernible difference between the monsters captured in these mirrors and their real counterparts is their lack of free will or perhaps a soul. A Macabre Mirror can contain countless images, with many Master Illusionists dedicating their entire lives to adding to their ever-growing collections. Most often, a Master Illusionist's achievements are concluded when a ritual goes awry, leading to their demise at the hands of the monster they were attempting to trap. Although Macabre Mirrors often hold dozens or even hundreds of exotic creatures, only as many as the Illusionist dares to control are released when the mirror is activated."

#name "Simulacrum"
#spr1 "./Confluence/MA_Iridia/Simulacrum1.tga"
#spr2 "./Confluence/MA_Iridia/Simulacrum1.tga"
#descr "A Simulacrum is a near-flawless reflection of an illusionist brought to life within the Chamber of Reflections – an ancient hall of enchanted mirrors. By using one of these mysterious mirrors, an Illusionist can attempt to imprint a perfect likeness of themselves within it, imbuing the reflection with a semblance of life and will, and bringing it to life.
This simulacrum appears indistinguishable from the original illusionist in every regard, mimicking their voice, movements, and even their mastery of illusion magic. However, while it can cast spells, create illusions, and even deceive others, it is little more than a hollow image, lacking the true essence of the one who created it. Despite its near-perfect imitation, subtle distortions appear when it’s far from the Chamber, or under intense scrutiny – a flicker in the light, a momentary blur in the air.
The Simulacrum exists in a liminal state between the living and the inanimate, its reflection woven into reality but never quite belonging to it. Should it stray too far from its mirrored birthplace for too long, it risks fading back into the reflections from which it was born."

#newmonster 6872
#name "Echo"
#spr1 "./Confluence/MA_Iridia/Echo1.tga"
#spr2 "./Confluence/MA_Iridia/Echo1.tga"
#descr "An Echo is the twisted result of a simulacrum daring to create a simulacrum of itself – a distorted, fractured copy of a copy, born from the flawed essence of its creator. When the spell is cast, and the magic mirrors of the Chamber of Reflections trap and reflect the image of the simulacrum, what emerges from the mirror is a pale, unnerving imitation.
An Echo is far less stable than its predecessor, flickering in and out of existence like a half-formed dream. Its features are warped – too sharp in some places, blurred in others – like a reflection in a shattered mirror. Its movements are unsettling, stuttering or lagging, as if reality itself struggles to maintain its form. The Echo mimics the original Illusionist, but with a subtle malevolence in its gaze, as though the magic that sustains it has corrupted its purpose.
Unlike the Simulacrum, which can pass for its creator in all but soul, the Echo radiates an unnatural wrongness. Its illusions are brittle and flawed, and it is prone to sudden, violent bursts of instability, as if it resents its existence as a mere shadow of a shadow. An Echo is a reflection that should have never been allowed to exist, and in the depths of its hollow form, something dark and ancient stirs, waiting for its chance to break free from the endless cycle of copying."

#newmonster 6871
#name "Fade"
#spr1 "./Confluence/MA_Iridia/Fade1.tga"
#spr2 "./Confluence/MA_Iridia/Fade1.tga"
#descr "A Fade is the grotesque result of an Echo daring to create a simulacrum of itself, a creature born from the very essence of degradation and corruption. This abomination is the third iteration, a dark echo of an echo, twisted and hollowed beyond recognition. The Fade is not merely an unstable copy – it is a creature of pure malice, animated by the perversion of magic, embodying the collapse of reality into nightmare. Fades are barely recognizable as reflections of their original caster. Their forms are constantly shifting, like shadows writhing in agony, flickering between shapes as if caught in an endless struggle to hold themselves together. Their faces, if they can still be called that, are an amalgamation of distorted features: eyes hollow and black, mouths stretched too wide into unnatural grins or gaping voids. The very air around them seems to warp, thick with the weight of their unnatural presence.
Where the Echo was a pale imitation, the Fade is a mockery of existence. It is filled with an insatiable malice, drawn to the essence of life itself, seeking to feed on the life-force of beings it can never become, and devour the very reality it can never belong to. Its touch leaves a stain of decay, unraveling the world around it. Magic warps, structures crumble, and even time seems to twist when it passes. It cannot create illusions like its predecessors, but instead, it distorts the perceptions of others, making them see horrors that aren’t there – grotesque visions of torment that weaken the mind and fray the senses. The Fade does not just deceive; it corrupts, seeping into the dreams, thoughts, and fears of those near it, leaving them broken in both body and soul.
The longer a Fade exists, the more dangerous it becomes. Eventually, it will attempt to replace its creators entirely – not by mimicry, but by devouring them.  It is a creation that should never have been, a walking reminder of the danger of tampering with the fragile boundaries between reality and illusion."

#descr "In the enigmatic Chamber of Reflections, master illusionists have uncovered a secret art – crafting entire pocket universes within enchanted mirrors. By skillfully pouring a vast array of images, dreams, and desires into the depths of these magical mirrors, they gradually transform what was once a reflection into something more – a real, tangible place. As the illusions solidify, the mirror begins to reflect a world that seems almost alive, until the boundary between illusion and reality vanishes entirely. The illusionist can then step through the glass, entering a personal paradise shaped by their own mastery.
These mirror realms are relatively small, contained within the enchanted glass, yet they offer an escape, a sanctuary molded by the illusionist’s own imagination and power. Every detail – down to the flicker of sunlight or the soft sway of trees – is born from their mind, creating a haven of perfection. At times, some illusionists will even choose to collaborate, combining their powers to craft idyllic worlds that they can share, forming elaborate and serene retreats beyond the reach of time.
However, such worlds, though real to the touch and sight, are inherently fragile. These miniature universes are sustained only by the continued presence and will of the illusionists who made them, and the faintest disturbance in their magic could see these perfect realms collapse back into mere reflections, swallowed by the mirror from which they were born. It is yet unknown what would happen to anyone within these pocket realms should the mirrors shatter with them still inside. Would the universe collapse around them, or would they be left stranded in an infinite void."

#descr "In the enigmatic Chamber of Reflections, master illusionists have uncovered a secret art – crafting entire pocket universes within enchanted mirrors. By skillfully pouring a vast array of images, dreams, and desires into the depths of these magical mirrors, they gradually transform what was once a reflection into something more – a real, tangible place. As the illusions solidify, the mirror begins to reflect a world that seems almost alive, until the boundary between illusion and reality vanishes entirely. The illusionist can then step through the glass, entering a personal paradise shaped by their own mastery.
These mirror realms are relatively small, contained within the enchanted glass, yet they offer an escape, a sanctuary molded by the illusionist’s own imagination and power. Every detail – down to the flicker of sunlight or the soft sway of trees – is born from their mind, creating a haven of perfection. At times, some illusionists will even choose to collaborate, combining their powers to craft idyllic worlds that they can share, forming elaborate and serene retreats beyond the reach of time.
However, such worlds, though real to the touch and sight, are inherently fragile. These miniature universes are sustained only by the continued presence and will of the illusionists who made them, and the faintest disturbance in their magic could see these perfect realms collapse back into mere reflections, swallowed by the mirror from which they were born. It is yet unknown what would happen to anyone within these pocket realms should the mirrors shatter with them still inside. Would the universe collapse around them, or would they be left stranded in an infinite void."

#descr "In the enigmatic Chamber of Reflections, master illusionists have uncovered a secret art – crafting entire pocket universes within enchanted mirrors. By skillfully pouring a vast array of images, dreams, and desires into the depths of these magical mirrors, they gradually transform what was once a reflection into something more – a real, tangible place. As the illusions solidify, the mirror begins to reflect a world that seems almost alive, until the boundary between illusion and reality vanishes entirely. The illusionist can then step through the glass, entering a personal paradise shaped by their own mastery.
These mirror realms are relatively small, contained within the enchanted glass, yet they offer an escape, a sanctuary molded by the illusionist’s own imagination and power. Every detail – down to the flicker of sunlight or the soft sway of trees – is born from their mind, creating a haven of perfection. At times, some illusionists will even choose to collaborate, combining their powers to craft idyllic worlds that they can share, forming elaborate and serene retreats beyond the reach of time.

#descr "In the enigmatic Chamber of Reflections, master illusionists have uncovered a secret art – crafting entire pocket universes within enchanted mirrors. By skillfully pouring a vast array of images, dreams, and desires into the depths of these magical mirrors, they gradually transform what was once a reflection into something more – a real, tangible place. As the illusions solidify, the mirror begins to reflect a world that seems almost alive, until the boundary between illusion and reality vanishes entirely. The illusionist can then step through the glass, entering a personal paradise shaped by their own mastery.
These mirror realms are relatively small, contained within the enchanted glass, yet they offer an escape, a sanctuary molded by the illusionist’s own imagination and power. Every detail – down to the flicker of sunlight or the soft sway of trees – is born from their mind, creating a haven of perfection. At times, some illusionists will even choose to collaborate, combining their powers to craft idyllic worlds that they can share, forming elaborate and serene retreats beyond the reach of time.
However, such worlds, though real to the touch and sight, are inherently fragile. These miniature universes are sustained only by the continued presence and will of the illusionists who made them, and the faintest disturbance in their magic could see these perfect realms collapse back into mere reflections, swallowed by the mirror from which they were born. It is yet unknown what would happen to anyone within these pocket realms should the mirrors shatter with them still inside. Would the universe collapse around them, or would they be left stranded in an infinite void."

#descr "In the enigmatic Chamber of Reflections, master illusionists have uncovered a secret art – crafting entire pocket universes within enchanted mirrors. By skillfully pouring a vast array of images, dreams, and desires into the depths of these magical mirrors, they gradually transform what was once a reflection into something more – a real, tangible place. As the illusions solidify, the mirror begins to reflect a world that seems almost alive, until the boundary between illusion and reality vanishes entirely. The illusionist can then step through the glass, entering a personal paradise shaped by their own mastery.
These mirror realms are relatively small, contained within the enchanted glass, yet they offer an escape, a sanctuary molded by the illusionist’s own imagination and power.

#descr "In the enigmatic Chamber of Reflections, master illusionists have uncovered a secret art – crafting entire pocket universes within enchanted mirrors. By skillfully pouring a vast array of images, dreams, and desires into the depths of these magical mirrors, they gradually transform what was once a reflection into something more – a real, tangible place. As the illusions solidify, the mirror begins to reflect a world that seems almost alive, until the boundary between illusion and reality vanishes entirely. The illusionist can then step through the glass, entering a personal paradise shaped by their own mastery.
These mirror realms are relatively small, contained within the enchanted glass, yet they offer an escape, a sanctuary molded by the illusionist’s own imagination and power. Every detail – down to the flicker of sunlight or the soft sway of trees – is born from their mind, creating a haven of perfection. At times, some illusionists will even choose to collaborate, combining their powers to craft idyllic worlds that they can share, forming elaborate and serene retreats beyond the reach of time.
However, such worlds, though real to the touch and sight, are inherently fragile. These miniature universes are sustained only by the continued presence and will of the illusionists who made them, and the faintest disturbance in their magic could see these perfect realms collapse back into mere reflections, swallowed by the mirror from which they were born. It is yet unknown what would happen to anyone within these pocket realms should the mirrors shatter with them still inside. Would the universe collapse around them, or would they be left stranded in an infinite void."

Every detail – down to the flicker of sunlight or the soft sway of trees – is born from their mind, creating a haven of perfection. At times, some illusionists will even choose to collaborate, combining their powers to craft idyllic worlds that they can share, forming elaborate and serene retreats beyond the reach of time.
However, such worlds, though real to the touch and sight, are inherently fragile. These miniature universes are sustained only by the continued presence and will of the illusionists who made them, and the faintest disturbance in their magic could see these perfect realms collapse back into mere reflections, swallowed by the mirror from which they were born. It is yet unknown what would happen to anyone within these pocket realms should the mirrors shatter with them still inside. Would the universe collapse around them, or would they be left stranded in an infinite void."

The enchantments cast by its masters ensure that the outside world remains oblivious to Iridia's existence, while the city's vibrant life thrives behind layers of glamour and deceit.
To enter Iridia is to be entranced. To leave is to lose the memory of a city that should not exist, and no longer does for the ones who leave it."

These illusory soldiers march with perfect discipline, their armor clinking, weapons gleaming, and their numbers vast and imposing. From a distance, they seem every bit as formidable as a true legion, their movements synchronized with uncanny precision.
The illusion is so flawless that the false soldiers cast shadows, stir dust, and even mimic the sounds of battle when engaged. They react to commands, form ranks, and charge toward the enemy with terrifying intent. It isn’t until an opponent clashes with these phantom warriors that the truth begins to unravel—strikes pass through their bodies, arrows meet no resistance, and even magic fails to make contact. By the time the ruse is revealed, the battlefield may already be in disarray. The confusion caused by the False Legion allows the illusionist’s true forces to gain an advantage, using the distraction to outmaneuver and disorient the enemy."

#newspell
#name "Danse Macabre"
#descr "Through this spell, an Illusionist conjures a macabre symphony composed by the Maestro Macabre, summoning faint and blurry illusions of a dozen or so skeletons that emerge at the distant edges of the battlefield. These spectral figures begin to dance toward the enemy in perfect harmony, their images becoming increasingly lifelike with each eerie step they take. As their dance approaches perfection, new spectral skeletons flicker into existence alongside them, bolstering the ranks of the dancing dead. The skeletal dancers maintain their relentless procession, continually spawning fresh illusions until the haunting melody fades and their dance concludes. This mesmerizing display generates a multitude of illusions, sowing confusion and fear within the enemy ranks, rendering them vulnerable to the Illusionist's true intentions."
#details "Illusory skeletons are summoned at the edges of the battlefield. Every few battle turns the last created illusion will spawn another one. This cycle will carry on several times, increasing the potential number of the summons five-fold at maximum."

#newspell
#name "Perpetual Illusion"
#descr "With this masterful deception an Illusionist creates a perpetual illusion. Several both incredibly complex yet laughably poor illusory soldiers will appear at the edges of the battle, charging towards the enemy ranks. Before long, these illusions will simply stop, turning impotent, and spawn a new set of broken illusions that will continue the charge in their stead for a short distance before also failing. Such a poorly created illusion would get any Illusionist thrown out of Iridia if not for the fact that the original illusions continue to spawn new, broken illusions for the remainder of the battle. Though the illusions quickly fall inert and stop posing any kind of threat, unless the perpetual illusion is dispelled with haste it will quickly overflow the battlefield with still illusions, creating a confusing mess for the enemy on the battlefield. Most enemies simply choose to ignore the presence of these illusions at first, as is the norm when dealing with Iridia trickery, not realizing the danger before they find themselves surrounded by an ever-increasing horde of illusions. Though breaking the cycle and dispelling the original illusions is a simple enough matter, it is a task which grows increasingly more difficult with every passing minute of the battle."

#descr "The art of Illusionism often focuses on altering the appearance of things through the manipulating of light. To project an image of something one must first know to project light. Similarly, to hide something one must know how to distort light. In recent years the Mirror Tower has focused much of its attention towards the art that has come to been known as light-splitting. 
A Mirror-Mage is a Master Illusionist who has successfully split light in front of the Prismatic Mirrors of the Mirror Tower, separating from his shadow and his very image, turning completely invisible in the process. One does not become a Mirror-Mage without some sacrifice however as splitting oneself inadvertently splits power as well, though many consider this a small price to pay for attaining god-like powers; turning invisible and existing in multiple forms at once."

#descr "The art of Illusionism often focuses on altering the appearance of things through the manipulating of light. To project an image of something one must first know to project light. Similarly, to hide something one must know how to distort light. In recent years the Mirror Tower has focused much of its attention towards the art that has come to been known as light-splitting. 
A Mirror-Mage is a Master Illusionist who has successfully split light in front of the Prismatic Mirrors of the Mirror Tower, separating from his shadow and his very image, turning completely invisible in the process. One does not become a Mirror-Mage without some sacrifice however as splitting oneself inadvertently splits power as well, though many consider this a small price to pay for attaining god-like powers; turning invisible and existing in multiple forms at once."

#descr "A Mirror-Mage Phantasm is a refracted part of the Mirror-Mage. Though it is not so much of a phantasm, being a quite literal and tangible being, it is still thought of as one, being nothing more than a simple likeness of the Mirror-Mage; a perfect image with no intellect of its own, part from basic instinct. Much like the shadow, the Mirror-Mage Phantasm exists outside the purview of the Mirror Mage's direct influence, though it remains linked to a greater whole."

The shadows seem to inherit the darker parts of one's nature during the light splitting as any mystical or dark knowledge seem to be primarily inherited by the shadow. Perhaps most interestingly, shadows seem to be banishable by priests. Many have already called into question whether the prismatic mirrors split the Illusionist's image or rather his soul and power."

#descr "A long time ago, the Mistress of Deceit was merely a mortal illusionist named Elyndra, born in the shimmering, ever-changing city of Iridia. From an early age, she displayed a talent for creating illusions so convincing that even her closest friends doubted their own senses. Elyndra reveled in watching others second-guess their reality, planting seeds of confusion and watching them grow. Her mentors in the Mirror Tower were left in awe of her skill, unaware that she was already using subtle trickery to manipulate their perceptions and cloud their judgment.
But admiration and praise were not enough for Elyndra. She desired not just mastery illusion but total dominion over the mind itself. She sought to wield deception to control others without them ever knowing they were under her spell.
Her rise to godhood began when she discovered a hidden artifact deep beneath the Mirror Tower—the Mirror of a Thousand Faces. This relic, a tiny shard of twisted reality, held the power to blur the line between truth and lie, allowing Elyndra to warp perceptions into realities. With this newfound power, Elyndra’s deceptions became truth that reshaped the world around her.
But Elyndra’s rise was never straightforward. She orchestrated the downfall of her rivals not through direct confrontation, but by turning them against one another. Some were trapped in endless reflections in her enchanted mirrors, doomed to chase their own images for eternity. Others vanished from memory entirely, their existence erased in the web of illusions Elyndra spun around them. 
Now, Elyndra claims dominion over deception and deceit. For as long as the shard of reality remains bound to her, Elyndra will remain a goddess, eternally reshaping the world through her deceit.

The Mistress of Deceit commands the Mists of Deception and will cast them during battle. She is also capable of manipulating the perceptions of scouts and spies, making her armies seem either impossibly vast or deceptively small."

#descr "Unlike its lesser kin, the Greater Phantasmagorian does not merely assume the form of its observer’s worst nightmares, it warps reality itself, blending the fabric of existence with the twisted visions of its prey. Its form is an ever-shifting void, impossible to define, as it manipulates the minds of those who behold it, creating landscapes of terror that blur the line between illusion and reality. In its presence, time fractures, and space distorts, trapping victims in endless cycles of fear and dread.
Not limited to merely projecting illusions into the minds of individuals, the Greater Phantasmagorian possess the power to alter entire realms, reshaping landscapes to match the darkest corners of thought. Dreamers who wander too far in their dreamwalks may find themselves trapped in these surreal nightmares, where time and space fracture and stretch in ways that defy reason. It is said that entire planes have been consumed by its influence, becoming eternal labyrinths of dread.
Masters Macabre revere the Greater Phantasmagorian with awe and caution and consider it a god-like being."

#descr "The Mirror Lord is an Illusionist of unparalleled power who has transcended his own mortality through the art of light-splitting. By performing an extraordinary feat of magic with the prismatic mirrors of the Mirror Tower, he has refracted his essence into three distinct parts; his living shadow, embodying his uninhibited impulses and darker nature; his manifest image, representing his mindless subconscious instincts; and his 'self', the intangible intellect and ego of the Mirror Lord. Donning a godly mantle, the Mirror Lord has assumed the role of a Pretender God. A master of magic, he is adept in multiple magical paths, wielding his diverse powers with unmatched proficiency.

The Mirror Lord Phantasm will gain the primary magic path, Glamour, in equal amount to the Mirror Lord.
The Mirror Lord Shadow will gain Death magic in an equal amount to the Mirror Lord."

Though the phantasm is independent in its own right, it is connected to a greater whole and cannot easily be destroyed while the Mirror Lord still lives. Even though the Mirror Lord's phantasm is the only tangible part of his refracted being, it is still considered to be a phantasm of a sort, as it is a simple likeness of the Mirror Lord, a mindless, near-empty husk, much like a phantasm captured in an enchanted mirror."

#newmonster 7814

#spr1 "./Confluence/MA_Iridia/Camille1.tga"
#spr2 "./Confluence/MA_Iridia/Camille2.tga"
#descr "The Maestro Macabre, once known as Camille Saint-Saëns, was not always a figure of terror and twisted divinity. He began life as a musical genius, a man whose haunting symphonies echoed through the grandest musical halls of the world. But within the swirling complexity of his compositions, something darker was always lurking, a desire to transcend mere sound and to captivate the minds and emotions of his audience with the feeling of dread he was trying to evoke with his music.
Obsessed with the belief that art could become something more than a passive experience, Camille delved into the arcane, finding ways to merge music and illusion. It was in the forbidden tomes of ancient illusionist of the macabre that he discovered the secret to manipulating not just perception, but reality itself. What began as small tricks – a haunting melody that conjured fleeting phantoms or unsettling visions during a performance – soon escalated into something far more sinister.
Saint-Saëns’ obsession grew with each performance. Each concert became a ritual, each composition a spell. His music began to pull the deepest, darkest nightmares from the minds of those who listened. These were not mere hallucinations. His power had grown so potent that these horrors manifested physically, twisting reality around them and becoming a part of the performance.
As his mastery grew, so did his delusions of grandeur. Saint-Saëns retreated from the public eye, rumored to have gone mad. When he reemerged, Camille Saint-Saëns the musical prodigy was gone. In his place stood the Maestro Macabre, a false god whose power lay in the manipulation and subjugation of the mind itself. With an almost divine command over one’s perception and sense, the Maestro instills the belief in others that he is, indeed, a god – his power undeniable in the minds of those ensnared by his influence. In his presence, the dominion of the One True God will diminish and people turn to worship the Maestro Macabre."

#selectnation 300
#name "Iridia" -- Iridia or Tirindur
#epithet "The Mendacious City"
#era 2 -- 2
#descr "Hidden behind a veil of trickery and illusions lies the city of Iridia, the home of the Illusionists, cunning and conniving mages that practice the subtle art of Illusionism. At the very heart of the great city stands the Mirror Tower, the center of the Illusionists' power, impossibly tall and constantly shifting and changing according to the whims of its peculiar occupants. It is here where great feats of Illusionism are performed and promising tricksters trained. The people of Iridia have long since learnt to live alongside the Illusionists and with all that entails. Illusions have become a part of everyday life in Iridia and most people go about their business politely ignoring whatever may be happening in their surroundings, be that a parade of dancing skeletons, or twenty-foot-tall giants clad in mirrors patrolling the streets. As Iridia is too small to have an organized standing army, and its rulers too disinterested in worldly matters and the administration of the same, the people primarily have to rely on mercenaries to defend the walls of their fine city. Many a mercenary company finds its way to the small and elusive Iridia, lured by offers of substantial pay from the Mirror Tower's seemingly inexhaustible treasure vaults. Iridian forces are perhaps small but are aided by powerful illusions. Many an invading warlord has laughed derisively at a small opposing force whose vain commander brings large, fragile mirrors to the field of battle. Most of those warlords have then had to watch in frustration and disbelief as their own ordered ranks turn into a chaotic, snarled mess, their soldiers distracted and confused by bright lights, frightened by visions only they can see, and cut down and trampled into the ground by soldiers and fantastical monsters that marched forth from the enchanted mirrors. Those facing Illusionists are advised to underestimate them at their own peril."
#summary "Race: Humans.
Military: Mercenaries and various types of illusions and phantasms. All national soldiers of Iridia are protected by glamour in friendly dominion.
Magic: Powerful Glamour, Astral, Death, some Nature and Earth.
Priests: Weak. 
Dominion: Conflict bonus -1. Dominion hides province ownership."
#brief "Iridia is a small city hidden behind a veil of illusions and deceptions. It is ruled by the masters of deceit and lies, the Illusionists of the Mirror Tower. The Illusionists of Iridia are capable of weaving complex illusions that hide or alter form, and are best known for trapping magic and images within mirrors and releasing them during battle. Iridia is defended by mercenary companies drawn to the city by the illusion of wealth."

#newspell
#name "Runic Bolt"
#descr "Dwarves, lacking the natural aptitude to wield magic like most other races often rely on magical crutches to channel their power through spell-singing and the crafting and inscribing of runes. 
By channelling their powers in such a manner, a Runic Bolt is conjured and hurled against enemies. Composed of pure runic magic, the bolt is capable of burning a hole through sturdy armor, and burning away one’s essence, severing the spirit from the flesh."

As their control over the runes sharpens, their voices resonate with greater power, allowing them to channel multiple bolts of magic simultaneously. These skilled mages are capable of conjuring not just a single Runic Bolt, but numerous bolts at once, hurling them at their enemies in a barrage."

Those of the gifted caste are even said to be able to hear the song of the Stone, the progenitor of the dwarven race. With this powerful ritual the caster is able to enter into a communion with the Stone and use the bond to gradually sense rich gold veins in distant mountain provinces. The Stone's song will then open up a tunnel, allowing the mining caste Prospectors to set up a rich gold mine within the mountain. This enchantment can only be used to sense gold veins within mountains in friendly dominion. If the bond between the caster and the Stone is severed, the tunnels created by the Stone will slowly collapse. As the gold veins are sometimes located very deep underground, tunnels to dangerous and unknown places may open up too."
#details "Each turn the global is active there is a 10% chance a Dwarven Gold Mine is created in mountain provinces with Val Morhen's dominion, and 5% change in caves. If the global is overcast or dispelled, Dwarven Gold Mines will be removed over a number of months, and may trigger minor population loss and unrest events, and Prospector deaths.

Additionally, there is a:
10% chance for a moderate Darkspawn attack in provinces with a Dwarven Gold Mine for as long as the global is active.
2% chance for a large Darkspawn attack in provinces with a Dwarven Gold Mine for as long as the global is active.
3% chance for a moderate Darkspawn attack in mountain provinces with Val Morhen's dominion for as long as the global is active.

Dwarven Gold Mines generate 125 gold, but are not considered gold mines for the purposes of 'Riches from Beneath' global."

These runes, etched with great precision and care by skilled artisans, are most often used to create enchanted items by channeling magic into them. Unbeknownst to the dwarves, the source of these crystals are the Titans – ancient, primordial gods of the dwarves – and they hold fragments of their immense power, which is channeled through the runes in a controlled manner. 
Unlike spells which are fleeting, the enchantments of the runes are stable and long-lasting. Runes are carried by individuals or embedded into homes and structures to ward off harm, given as gifts and tokens of goodwill, or crafted to protect warriors heading into battle. Even the most accomplished dwarven mages remain largely unaware that the runic scepters they wield channel power far greater than their own—a lingering connection to the magical essence of the Titans."

#descr "Apart from devising the Gate Stones, Heidrun created many other marvels and wonders. However, his greatest – and worst – creation was the eponymous sceptre. Crafted during the height of the wars for the survival of the dwarven race, it was envisioned as a tool to bolster the defenses of the dwarven kingdoms against the encroaching horrors of the Deep Roads that were ravaging the theigs. 
This sceptre carried the ability to create temporary portals to any place where the song of the Stone was strong, bypassing reliance on complex runic Gate Stones, and the mages needed to operate them.
However, instead of becoming a tool of survival, it quickly became a weapon of conquest. Ambitious dwarven lords seized the scepter and used it to strike unexpectedly at rival theigs. Armies poured through portals into unfortified halls, seizing treasures and territory. 
Civil war erupted in the midst of the larger existential threat, and many theigs fell — not to the horrors of the Deep Roads, but to their own kin – and the fractures within the dwarven kingdoms grew too great to mend. Many of the remaining theigs chose to destroy their own Gate Stones, believing them to be the cause of this sudden civil war and fearing that rival theigs might use the gates to attack them.
Horrified by what his creation had wrought, Heidrun conspired to hide the sceptre, sealing it away in a forgotten vault, surrounded by wards to mask its presence. But the damage had already been done. The numerous dwarven theigs now stood isolated and fractured, facing extermination one by one, holed up within their great cities.
To this day, Heidrun’s Scepter is remembered in equal parts as a wonder of the old world, and a symbol of its downfall. Legends say it remains hidden in the depths of ruins long lost to time, waiting for the day when a new wielder might claim it, either to unite the dwarven realms, or repeat the mistakes of the past."

Gold mining is one of the most difficult facets of this caste's work, requiring finesse and a hearty dwarven constitution to withstand the harsh working conditions. The trade of this mineral generates a significant portion of Val Morhen's revenues and as such is vital to the dwarven society.

Tunneling is considered to be beneath any of the warrior caste dignity. Consequently, most tunnelers are from the servant caste, or even from casteless dwarves looking to redeem their ancestry."

Placed in the relatively narrow dwarven tunnel-roads, the infernal contraption could completely block off a passage, burning anything in its path to cinder. While this creation proved successful initially, it ultimately failed to turn the tide of the war. The Siege Engines were all too slow to construct while the tunnels and roads the dwarves had built were numerous; too numerous even for the dwarves to count.

The Runesmiths of Val Morhen hold the knowledge of rune-crafting, the tightly-guarded process of imbuing weapons and armor with powerful magic and magical properties. This knowledge is secretly passed down from generation to generation between the Runesmiths, and is a means of preserving power and influence within the smith caste, and indeed the dwarven society. 

Runesmiths of Val Morhen can enter the Rune Forges in order to craft powerful and sophisticated weapons and armor for Rune Guards of the warrior caste. The process of crafting such armaments is very difficult and demanding, and requires substantial funds. It costs as much as ten gold pieces to procure the ores needed, and ten gold pieces more to pay the Runesmiths' services in order to create even one set of rune weapons and armor. Due to the exorbitant price very few Rune Guards are chosen and honored with such powerful armaments.

To forge and equip Rune Guards with superior weapons and armor, a Runesmith must enter the Rune Forge site. No more than two of each Rune Guard type will be outfitted each month and the price for outfitting each soldier will be twenty gold coins."

#descr "Magical talent is not something Dwarves are inherently blessed with. Rare are those who possess any magical capabilities and even those who do often struggle to diversify or advance their magical knowledge. As dwarves experience a unique and all-encompassing relationship to their progenitor, the Stone, they are most proficient in Earth magic. Their connection to the Stone is so great that those with magical talent claim that they hear the Stone sing to them. Those rare dwarves who do possess magical talents belong to the gifted caste. As dwarves from any caste, or even no caste, can exhibit magical talent, all those who do are given to the gifted caste. As such the gifted caste holds dwarves that draw ancestry from all the other castes, and holds varying degrees of influence within them all. The respectability of the gifted caste, as well as the presence of those initially of noble caste within it, grants the gifted caste significant power, allowing them to often vie for power against the noble caste. All dwarves of magical talent perform spells by singing the Stone's song and channelling their magic through runic sceptres, however Runemasters are exceedingly attuned to the Stone and gifted at spellsinging, and are able to perform spells much faster than their brethren. 

Runemasters do not suffer from the spell-singer slow casting penalty unlike other dwarves."

#name "Paragon"
#spr1 "./Confluence/MA_Val Morhen/Paragon1.tga"
#spr2 "./Confluence/MA_Val Morhen/Paragon2.tga"
#descr "Most of the noble houses in Val Morhen are founded by Paragons, which give their name to their House. However, not all noble houses are descended from Paragons. Sometimes warrior caste or smith caste families become nobility through great deeds or other means. Paragons are the elite of the dwarven culture, the pinnacle of dwarven excellence, and the one exception to the rigid caste structure as they can be drawn from any caste, even the casteless. They are the noble warriors, politicians, smiths and even children that all others seek to emulate, and they function as essential role models to all dwarves. While dwarves do not worship gods as such, a Paragon is like a god in the eyes of dwarves, which is attributed to the fact that the dwarves venerate their Ancestors, so a living Paragon is considered as a living Ancestor. The word of a Paragon surpasses in weight even the word of a king—even if the former's title does not grant official power. Dwarven cities are decorated by monolithic lifelike statues of Paragons from days past. There are few living Paragons as many dwarves are named Paragon only after their death. The act by which one becomes a Paragon can vary. Typically, it is a feat of bravery in warfare, or an incredible invention, but it can also be something as simple as embodying the ideals and tasks of one's caste to an unprecedented perfection. "

#descr "Few paragons manage to rise beyond the already exalted expectations of their station, and achieve deeds truly remarkable that reshape the dwarven society and elevate them to the rank of a high paragon. In the past, such recognition was reserved for the paragons who established new theigs, devised new technologies such as the creation of the golems, or led their people through great trials, securing their future and ensuring the survival and prosperity of their kin.
High Paragons are not just revered for their personal achievements, but for their ability to transform the world around them in lasting and meaningful ways."

#descr "Deep beneath the mountains, in the last dwarven theig, a fierce battle was fought for the very survival of the dwarven race. Faced with extinction, the Artificers, Runesmiths, and Paragons of Val Morhen all desperately fought to invent a weapon capable of turning the tide of war. One that would triumph where all others had failed. Finally, they succeeded in creating a magical forge called the Anvil of the Void where the first Golems were animated; hulking monstrosities hewn of stone and sheets of metal that were capable of pulverizing the Darkspaw and which could easily be directed by Control Rods from a safe distance. Legions of Golems were created, and soon enough Val Morhen stood victorious in the crushed remains of Darkspawn. The triumph of Val Morhen came at a heavy cost however, as a dark secret emerged. Incapable of shaping and animating the Golems solely by magic, the Paragons resorted to a heinous crime, encasing living dwarves in a Golem suit and pouring molten gems though the eye holes, mouth hole, and joints of the armor. Before the molten Earth gems are cooled, the armor is hammered and shaped to perfection. The act itself produced volatile and crazed Golems that would more often slay their brethren than their enemies, so a Control Rod was fashioned to keep them obedient and servile, and their deranged will suppressed. As long as there is even a single commander wielding a Control Rod in the presence of Golems, they will remain servile, but should the shackles be broken, disaster may follow.

This Dwarven Golem retains its faculties and does not require the use of a Control Rod."

#descr "Deep in the mountains of Val Morhen exists one of the oldest and most fierce military organizations known to dwarves; the Legion of the Dead. Those who join the Legion undergo symbolic funerals where last goodbyes are spoken to friends and family and all ties to their former lives are cut. Henceforth, their fate is consigned and their lives used in service to the dwarven kingdom. Dead Legionaries venture forth to reclaim their once vast kingdom from all manners of foul creatures that now infest the underside of the mountains. The Legion was formed at the height of the Blight wars, and since its resolution has been steadily dwindling in number, with no immediate danger from the Darkspawn to bolster the Legion's ranks, though the dark dwarven tunnels and roads that run deep beneath the Earth's surface are still filled with all manners of creatures that still pose a significant danger. The life of a Dead Legionnaire is usually a hard, bloody, and short-lived one. Some last months, while others last for years before second death claims them, but claims them it does, and all meet the same, cold fate, far from the familiar caves of Val Morhen, in the dark and long-forgotten recesses of their once vast kingdom, trying to reclaim their glory and inheritance.
Most Dead Legionaries are battle-hardened warriors and may bear wounds from past battles."

These dwarves abandon their homes, titles, and all bonds of kinship, dedicating their lives to a relentless quest for redemption through combat against the most fearsome enemies they can find.
Slayers seek out the darkest and most dangerous corners of the Deep Roads, throwing themselves against abominations lurking in the forgotten depths. For them, every swing of the axe or hammer is a step closer to an honorable death that might erase the stain of their past.
Despite their once shameful lives, Slayers are often revered among the dwarves, their courage and attempt at redemption a source of inspiration. Countless songs and sagas have been composed in their honor, telling of their last stands, where they fell surrounded by the bodies of their foes. To be remembered as a Slayer is to leave behind a legacy ancestors can be proud of, and descendants can look up to."

#descr "Deep in the mountains of Val Morhen, among the halls of the dwarves, exists a rare and grim order of spellcasters known as the Dead Wizards. While the Legion of the Dead is renowned for its warriors, wizards have been known to occasionally join it as well. Much like the legionaries, these mages are likewise expected to sever ties to their past lives and dedicated their remaining days to the service of the dwarven kingdom.
Like their warrior counterparts, they undergo symbolic funerals, bidding farewell to loved ones and renouncing all claim to their former identities and rank. From that moment forward, they are consigned to an inevitable and often gruesome death in the Deep Roads, their magic used to light up the deepest, darkest tunnels where even torchlight falters, and ward fellow legionnaires from the monstrous horrors lurking in the Deep Roads. 
Though once the Legion of the Dead once counted many wizards among its ranks, the years of relative peace have lessened the need for such sacrificial dedication. Yet, the tunnels remain as perilous as ever, and the few remaining Dead Wizards insufficient for the task at hand, to reclaim what has been lost."

These sprawling underground realms are home to a myriad of wonders and horrors—strange creatures, ancient races, fantastical beings, and entities that dwell in the depths, often unseen and unknowable.
The deeper one dares to ventures into these dark tunnels, the stranger they become and the more pressing and sinister its darkness.
But should one travel deep enough into the womb of the earth, light begins to emanate again, as small glowing crystals begin to line up the walls of the caves and tunnels. As one travels further and further, the light intensifies, revealing immense chambers and cathedral-like caves that gleam with a brightness rivaling that of the surface at midday. These vast caves are not illuminated by sunlight, but by endless crystalline formations, whose radiance mimics natural daylight and casts vibrant colors across the cave walls and ceilings.
Here, the Titans slumber, primordial gods of living crystal who shimmer with a kaleidoscope of colors. The Titans are the progenitors of the dwarven race, though few know this these days, for this truth has long since been stricken from the Stone by the Sheperate."

These guardians are eternal, able to reconstitute themselves from shards if shattered, their fractured forms drawn inexorably back together by the inexhaustible will of the earth. They once dwelled in the labyrinthine caverns where light dances from endless crystalline formations, protecting the sacred chambers of the dormant Titans.  
Only three crystal golems were ever awakened. The first of the three was corrupted by a sinister power through blood magic ages ago and lost to the Titans, vanishing without a trace.
The second was lost to a raging molten river, the searing currents swallowing its crystalline body whole. Though its shards might still endure in the fiery depths, its form is doubtlessly lost in the endless tunnels.
The third and last one abandoned its sacred duty. In time, it grew restless in the shadow of the slumbering Titans. Burdened by an incomprehensible yearning, it departed the sacred chambers, wandering into the unknown reaches of the world, forsaking its creators, never to be seen since."

#descr "Beyond the labyrinth of tunnels and caverns that form the veins of the earth, in impossible depths where few, if any tread, lies the Heart of the Mountain, a Titan of immense power, an ancient progenitor of the dwarven race. This entity takes the form of a massive crystal formation radiating mesmerizing light, shimmering in a spectrum of colors that seems to constantly shift. The dormant titan is an awe-inspiring sight—so vast that it can be seen from leagues away in its gigantic cavern, and shines so brightly as to bring the light of day.
The power of the titans is woven into the very foundation of the earth, a primordial force that created the very rock and stone of the world. It is said that if one were to stand before the Heart long enough, they might feel an overwhelming sense of connection to the world itself, as if the mountain, the earth, and the titan within had become one. It hums with an ancient magic, a quiet song that reverberates through the Stone, holding the power to shape and reshape the earth itself."

These statutes are not mere decoration, they are vessels of the Stone, and hold real power. Through the deep respect and reverence of the dwarves, the spirits of these honored ancestors can be called back from the Stone and into the statues themselves.
The Paragon Statue is one such vessel which contain the bound spirit of an ancient and much revered dwarf. The spirit within urges its descendants to strive for greatness and earn their place alongside the paragons of old. To stand before it is to stand before a legacy, and to hear the call to carry that legacy forward.

Under the influence and guidance of the Paragon Statue, a random Paragon will be exalted to the position of a High Paragon. Should the High Paragon perish, a new one will be exalted."

Though its identity has been lost to time, much like the dwarven theigs, it yet stands in the Deep Roads, awaiting for descendants worthy of its gifts. Worthiness is determined not by caste or station, but by dedication, ingenuity, and the purity of intent. To those who earn its favor, the Great Anvil grants items imbued with unparalleled magic, from swords that never dull to armor impervious to any strike.

#selectnation 312
#name "Val Morhen"
#epithet "The Last Theig"
#era 2 -- 2
#descr "Val Morhen, The Kingdom under the Mountain, is the last refuge of the dwarven race. It is the only theig, the only great city to have survived the Blight wars, a century long struggle that all but consigned the dwarven race to a distant memory.
The crumbling and eroding subterranean roads that once used to connect countless dwarven theigs across the land are now silent and dark. Once great feats of architecture of ingenious design and craftsmanship now lay collapsed and in ruin. Grim remains of the sprawling dwarven kingdoms decorate the undersides of the mountains. But Val Morhen still stands glorious and invictus, and bustling with the activity of the grim-faced dwarves. Fire-belching siege engines crawl about as various other contraptions and machines are being constructed. Great ore and gold mines keep production afloat as the Rune Forges of the great city echo with the banging and clanking of the Runesmiths' hammers, and the great Anvil of the Void still births indestructible stone golems that keep vigil and protect the last great gates of the dwarven kingdom. Deep under the mountains, the Legion of the Dead marches out into the brooding dark, determined to reclaim the dwarven kingdom, and all its lost secrets and memory. Yet none speak of the horrid stench of death and decay that still fills the dwarven deep roads, or of the encroaching taint that spreads through the very earth, like a blight.

When conquering independent lands for the first time, the dwarves of Val Morhen have a 12% chance to rediscover a gold mine in mountains and caves, and an additional 12% to rediscover either an iron, copper, or silver mine in all other land types."
#summary "Race: Dwarves. Partial darkvision and mountain survival. 
Military: Heavy Infantry, crossbows, arbalests, siege engines. Can equip Rune Guard with superior weapons and armor.
Magic: Earth, Fire, some Air and Astral.
Priests: Moderate.
Bless: The Dragonguard Dragonfire weapon benefits fully from all weapon blesses even though it is a breath based weapon."
#brief "Val Morhen is the last dwarven theig. It is the last remnant of the once vast and sprawling kingdom. Siege engies, giant rock golems, and sturdy, grim-faced dwarves keep guard over the last great dwarven city, as the Legion of the Dead ventures forth to reclaim their destiny."

#name "Black Sausage" 
#descr "Black Sausage is a rare and peculiar delicacy in the Markgrafdom, prized for its rich, iron-heavy flavor and its unsettlingly smooth texture. Made from a blend of blood, ground bone meal, and a mysterious assortment of ‘spices’, the sausage has a tantalizing aroma. While highly sought after, it is not without its quirks. Some claim the sausages never spoil, no matter how long they are left hanging in dark, cool larders—a trait those suspicious attribute to necromantic preservation techniques. Some note the sausages even seems to ‘bleed’ when sliced, oozing a viscous black liquid.
Despite its strange properties, Black Sausage remains a staple at banquets and feasts, often paired with a goblet of fortified red wine or—if one dares—a ladle of Gore Pudding. Curiously, those who consume it with regularity are said to develop a peculiar resistance to plagues, pestilences, and diseases, though whether this is due to some inherent quality of the sausage or a side effect of necromantic meddling is a matter of unsettling debate. For reasons best left unexplored, the Markgraf himself is said to have a particular fondness for this delicacy."

The crimson liquid within is thick and sluggish, swirling unnaturally as if alive. Those who partake report feeling an immediate surge of vitality and strength, but this newfound power is fleeting. Once the effects subside, the drinker is stricken with a mysterious and debilitating disease. Whether this affliction is a curse tied to the chalice or simply the Markgraf’s dark sense of humor remains unknown."

Initial attempts to sell the tainted beer were met with severe poisoning and reports of hallucinations and ghost sightings, at which point the remaining kegs were dumped on the streets where they eventually found their way to the ever-growing ghoul population which found the peculiar flavor of the beer inviting. Seeing a whole new potential market, the Markgraf jumped at the opportunity and rebranded his patented brew. The working conditions since the union accidents haven't improved much in the brewery and accidental drowning are still reported regularly." -- is a type of poison in itself hence reduce poisonres, those who drink think they halucinate ghosts, become a bit roudy, drunk morale, can only be stomacked by undead who are seemingly soothed by the poison

#descr "To gather any larger group of Hoburghers can often prove to be an insurmountable feat, something that can be seen in the traditional Hoburg defense force, the militia. The militia consists of the free Hoburghers gathering every Sunday to parade with crude metal helmets and eat fruitcake. The militia is usually a sorry sight and does not provide much in terms of fighting power. Being badly armed and small in stature, they offer no real resistance. It is often assumed that the compact stature of the Hoburghers originates from their close affinity with the earth that they traditionally toil, as it tries to pull them back down. However, some documentation of their earlier history have revealed partial evidence that they originally lived in burrows, living off of worms and dead animals. It is possible that their great appetite stems from this earlier constant hunger."

However, the original Hammerers considered their hammers crude as they were often mistaken for smithing apprentices. Looking for something more dignified, they worked with some local smiths - who definitely did want to be mistaken for the crude Hobmark Hammerers - to produce a hammer that both could strike through the skulls of the undead and plate armor while looking stylish.

If one asks a Hammerer the answer would instead be that the hammers are the trademark of Luzern’s Fine Metal Wares which gives it its name, but as they are pretentious and snobby, it is obvious that the former origin of the name rings closer to the truth.

The Hog Hussars are more lightly armored than the Hog Knights, sporting only a light cuirass and favoring a Hobmark saber, making them deadly as they circle the enemy foot soldiers."

Due to the clause - and the almost sacred nature of business-contacts between the Hoburgs - they are bound to fulfill their contracts. The unwillingness to actually die turns them into more vicious and less aware creatures. As they almost act on instinct, one has to beware of his bodyguards whenever one is in a meeting with the Ghoul Baron."

Though the Hoburghers generally lack an understanding and prowess in the arts of magic, some seem to still have an understanding for the art of Necromancy, perhaps due to their close association with the soil. A few years ago there was even a Hoburg Necromancer, Sigsimunda Strobel, at this very College, who was not without insight into the Dark Arts. Recently the Nekromants gained access to the Markgraf’s council, because they cooperated in finding a way to copy the Hoburg manufactures. Being well-versed in the art of preservation, one of the first manufactures to be populated sole by undead workers was the manufacture of ‘Hermann Flesher’s Fine Pickled Meats’. There were some complaints of fingers in the pickles, which pitched the Markgraf into a lengthy legal battle with the Fletcher family.

Nekromants, Grand Nekromant, and Nekromant Liches will create Gore Puddles in provinces with a laboratory and sufficient corpses. Only a single Gore Puddle may be created per month."

None of its previous hungers drive it on and it is just a lingering memory of a Hoburgher. In the opposite case it is just a mindless hunger driving it. It is difficult to revive a hoburg and have the resulting corpse not be either reduced to a catatonic state, or overwhelmed by hunger. The easiest way to let the subject of the revivification retain some memories would be to start the reanimation process just a few minutes before the subject dies. As such it is not a popular procedure, but lured by the promise of eternal life and eternal dinners, some of the markgrafs let themselves be talked into this by the nekromants."

For a few generations this remote area of the Hoburg society was more or less self-sufficient, if a bit leaner than their neighbors. The Markgraf managed to live well off his subjects and no dissenters to his rule survived to tell any tales. Many Hoburgers of ill repute have found a refuge in the towns of the Markgrafdom, which had already broken with the customs of the Hoburg society. As the Markgraf’s domains are more barren and worn down than the rest the Hoburg lands, the Markgrafs have tried every means available to improve the lot of their subjects and themselves."

	#descr "Though it long appeared as if the Nekromants in fact ruled the Markgraf’s domains, some recent news seem to indicate that the Markgraf was indeed in control the whole time, or at least tried to be. Spending the money earned from manufactures and settled lawsuits on research in order to investigate an old rumor in the Markgraf annals, he hoped to gain power for himself. We at the College of Cerebra Magni were happy to be able to present the results of our studies, which indicated that the Nekromant could aid the Markgraf in achieving a status of powerful undeath. The disadvantage being that he requires the blood of living people on a constant basis, though not necessarily that of Hoburghers. There are some uncertainties as to how he received our results, because the envoys that were sent with the results seem to have disappeared during their travels. However, the Markgraf has since paid the monies due and even offered a stipend for young scholars to travel to the Markgrafdom to study."

Their wings, now resembling tattered, leathery sails, span wide enough to cast shadows when they take flight. These creatures are often seen roosting in the abandoned castles and forgotten tombs scattered across the Markgraf’s lands. Many citizens of Markgrafdom have learned to stay indoors after dusk, lest they become a victim of these monstrous creatures.
It is said that the Overgrown Bat's blood is thick with dark magic, and that its flesh and leathery wings are often harvested by Nekromants who use them to craft cursed artifacts and tinctures."

In order to avoid the usual problem of lost body parts and sometimes the botched hunger of the undead, the Nekromants developed a ritual involving a graveyard, some strong Hoburg ale, incense and a very sweet pie to turn the twice dead into ghosts, separating their body from their soul. However, the scheme failed, because the ghostly remains could not be contained, and the Ghosts would bicker incessantly, forcing the Nekromants to move their premises."

#name "Ancient Master"
#descr "The Ancient Master had been dead for so long that most Hoburghers assumed he’d gotten rather good at it. It was noted among his subjects that his name has long-since been lost to time, which was probably just as well since names can cause all sorts of trouble when you’re trying to maintain an air of mystery. Instead, he was known only by the title of ‘Ancient Master’.
He lives—or rather, continues to persist—in a dilapidated keep made of stone, sealed behind an iron gate so rusty it could be considered made of bronze. No banners hang from his keep and no festivals are celebrated in his honor.
While no one has seen the Ancient Master leave the keep in centuries, he still manages to make his presence felt. Villages under his rule are unnervingly quiet and the inhabitants toil away in silence under the bony gaze of his skeletal foremen, their labors directed toward inscrutable ends. Those who dare ask are put to work so they may find out.
His lands are hardly a gardener’s paradise. Crops refuse to grow in his domain, unless one counts the gnarled roots and peculiar fungi sprouting near ancient burial grounds. The rivers moved sluggishly, carrying a murky blackness, and even the air seemed reluctant to linger. Yet, for all its barrenness, the Ancient Master’s domain thrives in its own peculiar way. Trade caravans laden with unholy wares—charms of bone, macabre delicacies, and tinctures said to slow decay—traverse his borders, enriching his coffers and spreading his influence beyond Markgrafdom."

#descr "The Vampire Markgraf is a peculiar and deeply unsettling figure in the annals of Hoburg society who has embraced vampirism as a personal triumph over mortality and an eternal claim to power. 
The Markgrafdom bears the scars of its ruler’s unholy ascension. The lands are pale and weary, much like their inhabitants, who toil under the weight of his eternal rule. 
The Markgraf himself surrounds his rule with the veneer of Hoburg respectability and the typical pomp of a noble, from imitating the trappings of the Burgmeister to maintaining grand banquets—albeit with more black pudding and fresh pig’s blood than his peers might find palatable. His fascination with appearances does not distract from his hunger, however. It is well known that the Markgraf rarely permits his court to adjourn without claiming a few of the guests, whether through willing offerings or more coercive measures."

#descr "Hoburg society is known for its love of tradition, community, and the sort of quiet, unassuming life that involves a lot of sausages, beers, and fruit cakes. Yet even the most well-ordered community has its exceptions, and the Ghost Markgraf is theirs. Once a Hoburg of ambition and importance, he clung to power and legacy with a grip that death itself couldn’t quite loosen. Now, he endures as a restless spirit, bound to his lands and the castle he once ruled in life.
The lands of the Markgrafdom are cloaked in an unnatural fog, and the modest fields, once neatly tended, now lie fallow. Under the Markgraf’s domain, the dead, it seems, are now as reluctant to leave as their lord. Generations of Hoburgs have lived—and not quite stopped living—under the Ghost Markgraf’s watch. Oaths sworn in life still bind them, upheld even after the small technicality of death.
The Ghost Markgraf’s rule is one of unnerving order, enforced by spectral servants who have an irritating knack for discovering hidden stashes and larders while collecting taxes. Life - or the lack of it - under the Markgraf’s rule may seem strange, but one thing is certain; the Ghost Markgraf is proof that, for some, the end is only the beginning of a managerial career."

#name "Ghoul Markgraf"
#descr "Hoburg society, with its emphasis on fairness, community, and avoiding anything too dramatic, doesn’t take kindly to absolute rule. Yet, there is one figure who cares about those traditions about as much as he cares about proper table manners, the Ghoul Markgraf. Once a Hoburg of notable ambition, he stumbled into an ancient curse and now enjoys an existence best described as ‘uncomfortably prolonged.’ Severed from his kin and most social norms, he rules alone over Markgrafdom, a place so remote and uninviting that even maps seem reluctant to acknowledge it.
The lands of Markgrafdom are barren, the air reeks of decay, and the locals have long since stopped discussing what goes into the stew. No one who is summoned to the Markgraf’s fortress ever comes back, which might explain why invitations are so rarely accepted. Still, the Ghoul Markgraf has an undeniable knack for keeping his people alive, if not exactly well-fed, and his methods—while grim—have kept his borders secure.
Markgrafdom has become a haven for Hoburgs who don’t quite fit anywhere else: outcasts, misfits, and those whose moral compasses were last seen heading south. The customs of traditional Hoburg life—like having a tasting of sausages and beer with your neighbor—have been largely abandoned in favor of survival and a sort of grim practicality of tasing your neighbor. Fear and necessity are what bind the Markgraf’s subjects to him, and even death doesn’t seem to provide much of an escape."

#name "Wraith Markgraf"
#descr "The Wraith Markgraf is said to have ascended beyond the tedious requirement for flesh or bone, existing in a state between ‘here’ and ‘not quite here’. Whether this transformation was the result of a curse or a deliberate act, or a particularly ambitious bout of dieting remains a point of speculation. What is certain is that the Markgraf’s soul is no longer fully tethered to the material world.
His court is a hollow place, stripped of the warmth of mortal rulers, attended by spirits bound in chains of forgotten oaths. Those who have seen him speak of a figure adorned with ceremonial robes and tarnished insignias of his former station. Despite his unearthly appearance, the Ancient Master remains remarkably shrewd, playing the long game in a way only someone with all of eternity to spare can truly master. His domain is quiet—eerily so. Villages remain neat and orderly, its inhabitants timid and reluctant to venture outside. Graves remain scrupulously undisturbed, not because the inhabitants are forgotten, but because no one wants to find out what might happen if they’re woken up. 
Those rare travelers who dare traverse the Markgraf’s domain speak of encountering pale figures on the road, offering warnings in voices too faint to hear clearly. Those who fail to heed the advice are seldom seen again, and those who are seen again tend to wish they weren’t.
Curiously, the Wraith Markgraf's treasury is seldom empty. Rumors persist of strange tithes arriving in the dead of night—small caskets filled with trinkets from distant lands, their origins a mystery. Some say these offerings come from the Markgraf’s spectral envoys, collecting debts owed in lifetimes long forgotten. Whether this is true or just a story told to keep children indoors is anyone’s guess, but one thing is clear: the Wraith Markgraf runs his domain with a thoroughness that would make even the most fastidious accountant shiver."

Rumors circulate that the Grand Nekromant, his closest advisor, now holds sway over the affairs of the Markgrafdom. The Markgraf, for his part, staunchly denies these claims, though his increasingly erratic behavior raises suspicions.
In his quest for stability, the Nekromant Markgraf has embraced the use of undead labor across his lands. Skeletal farmhands now till the fields, bone-thin millers run the mills, and shambling workers haul goods with a level of enthusiasm best described as ‘uncomplaining’. Their ceaseless toil has driven down costs, but also given the still living populace something to talk about in hushed tones.
The Hoburghers of the Markgrafdom have grown accustomed to the sight of skeletal farmhands and shambling servants, and bone-laden wagons trundling toward the castle, though wary and tight-lipped, they rarely discus of what they witness among each other.  
Despite the Markgraf’s efforts to stabilize his realm, his reliance on necromancy has not been without economic repercussions. The influx of undead labor has led to plummeting wages, while the decaying remains of the soulless have created unsanitary conditions that have sparked legal disputes. Even the Markgraf’s court has taken on an unmistakable air of foreboding. Where once noble Hoburghers dined and debated, they now shuffle silently among thralls and shambling corpses with an air of polite discomfort that suggests they’d rather be anywhere else. The Markgraf’s Nekromant advisors are ever-present, their skeletal familiars often found sifting through the ledgers of the realm, ensuring the flow of corpses to the laboratories and crypts."

Travelers report seeing massive skeletal wings cutting through the night sky, accompanied by the sound of rattling bones and a low roar that chills the blood. Villages in the region remain eerily quiet, their inhabitants refusing to discuss the Markgraf or his monstrous transformations. Those who persist in asking questions find themselves politely but firmly escorted to the dungeons from which they never return.
Curiously, while the Dracograf’s lands bear the scars of devastation, they are remarkably free from external threats. Invading armies have been reluctant to enter the Markgraf’s domain, ever since a skeletal dragon was seen soaring through the skies, leaving behind only scorched fields and shattered siege engines in its wake."

#descr "Many confuse Hoburg Brawlers and take them for angry halflings that like to fist fight and cause trouble after one too many pints of beer. Indeed, Hoburg Brawelers delight in beer much like all Hoburgs, but they are not your typical taverns brawlers. They are uncharacteristically skilled and specialize in taking down creatures many times their own size. Despite many a heroic tale of Hoburg Brawalers overcoming great odds and bringing down mythical creatures they are still not taken seriously quite often due to their unimposing size."

#name "Markgrafdom"
#epithet "The Necrophagy"
#era 2 -- 2
#descr "Markgrafdom is a remote and unwelcoming colony of the Hoburg society. It is a dreary and barren place ruled by the infamous Markgraf. The subjects of the Markgraf are a quiet and suspicious people. Strangers who come to visit will find that the doors are closed and no one will speak to them in the tavern. Markgrafdom is unlike any other Hoburg settlement and it has long since broken customs with the rest of the Hoburg society. Over the years it has become a hive of scum and villainy where all types of unsavory characters have found refuge, but chief among them the Nekromants - Hoburgers with an affinity for the necromantic arts. The aging Markgraf has seen the potential of using necromancy for his own ends and has put the Nekromants to all kinds of projects. Ever since, dark and foreboding rumors have started circulating about the Markgraf's ascension to godhood and the apparent ghoul epidemic that accompanied it.
The settlements of Markgrafdom are affected with a horrible curse. The Markgraf's rumored ascension has caused the surrounding lands to wither and succumb to decay. As the plague spreads the inhabitants of Markgrafdom fall deathly ill but do not die. Instead, they slowly develop a ravenous desire for rotten flesh as they turn into ghouls. Though all lands under the Markgraf's domain are affected with the Curse, the plague spreads more rapidly in the tightly packed fortified settlements of Markgrafdom than in the open countryside."
#summary "Race: Hoburgs. Forts have a 15% chance to spread disease among troops, non-forted provinces 5%. Nation receives a 40% income bonus in farms during Summer.
Military: Light and medium infantry, crossbows, light cavalry. All Hoburg units have a ghoul second shape upon death. Mages in ghoul form will receive +1 Death magic.
Magic: Nature, Water, Earth, Death. Can collect 'Hands of Glory' via casting national spells and use them for lichcraft. 
Priests: Weak."

#msg "Vitor is a mystical and holy mountain whose tall peaks reach towards the sky and pierce the clouds. It is a sanctuary for zmays and vilas, but most importantly home to the zmayevit vityazes. The mountain is a clandestine place hidden from the world by powerful enchantment and veiled by glamour. Those who seek it out are gently swayed by the magic of the mountain to take different paths, leading away from it. One can only find it through sheer happenstance, or by being led there by the whims of the mountain itself. Folk fortunate enough to stumble upon this clandestine place are mesmerized by its magic and unparalleled beauty and become obsessed with it. However, it is said that the mountain has a will of its own and moves around the world, never to be found in the same place twice. Many have wasted their entire lives searching for Vitor, drawn either by the legends and stories of its wonders, or by their obsession and need to find it again. None ever do.

Vitor Mountain is a mystical place and will continue to travel between Svarogian lands, never staying in the same place for long, always having to be searched for again and again.[Vitor Mountain]"

The presence of such a being is an affront to pretender gods, for those who realize his influence over their lives often choose to worship the Usud as their god instead. Sudjaye are the servants of the Usud who decide the fate of the Svarogian people in his stead."

#newspell

#name "Forest of Bound Souls"
#descr "The walnut tree is considered to be a holy tree in Svarogia and belongs to the goddess of Death. It is forbidden for children and young people to plant the tree, for those who plant it will die once the girth of the tree's trunk is equal to the neck of whoever planted it. It is at that point that the tree is ready to receive souls and becomes a spectral tree in which the spirits of the ancestors can be bound. Such a tree should never be carelessly cut down for it will infuriate the spirits of the ancestors. 
The duties of the goddess of Death are never-ending in Svarogia where death is common and the souls that need to be ferried to the Underworld plentiful. Sometimes, when there is too much death and too many souls to be harvested, she will hide the souls of the deceased in walnut trees, until she can return and complete her duties. 
With this ritual, the caster will enchant the walnut trees of a distant land and place a glamour on them so that once a soul is bound within, the trees will remain hidden from the goddess' sight, preventing her from retrieving the souls and ferrying them to the Underworld, thus creating a haunted forest."
#details "For this ritual to work, the province must have at least a single site slot available. 
For roughly within the first year after casting the ritual, 3-6 ghosts may be released via 'Release Souls' spell,
Within the second year of casting the ritual, 6-10 ghosts may be released via 'Release Souls' spell,
Approximately two years after casting the ritual, 12-18 ghosts may be released via 'Release Souls' spell."

It is said that the raskovnik is impossible to find. Few believe it even exists. It cannot be found in daytime, for the flower only blossoms in the dark of night, and closes up when it sees the first rays of sunlight. Even if one could see the flower, nobody even knows what it even looks like. Those who know of it say the flower possesses fantastical powers and is capable of breaking bonds and locks of any kind, and even releasing cursed or bound souls. An old and little known Svarogian legend holds that once upon a time, a crafty peasant put heavy chains on his legs, and wandered the meadows in the dead of night, seemingly aimlessly. Even as whispers and gossip of madness spread across the village, and other villagers started avoiding him, the peasant persisted, until one night the chains suddenly fell off, and he knew that he'd finally found the raskovnik.

For one to find the fabled raskovnik, they must be bound with leg chains and sent to sneak across the land in the dead of night."

Such a person often also bears distinct birthmarks, visible upon childbirth, that reveal their true nature. It is commonly held that a mora infant will lose her magical power if only her true name and the fact that she indeed is a mora are shouted out immediately after she has been born. However, this rarely happens due to the stigma such a proclamation would carry both for the family and the child in question. Though moras do not outright murder their victims, they are known for being able to enter the dreams of others and turning them into nightmares."

They appear to unwary travelers who find themselves on dark and lonely roads, and take the form of young and beautiful women with wild, untied hair, wearing ethereal white dresses. Though their striking visage alone is often enough to lure naive men who foolishly give chase, the osenyas also possess strange powers and are able to completely enthrall their victims, assuming they hear the sound of their voice and but a single uttered word. Once a victim has been lured or enthralled, an osenya will typically lead them to fall off a precipice, into their death. As osenyas shy away from light, all those who travel at night know to do so only in the company of torchlight. They are said to be difficult to kill, or even wound, for a weapon used against an osenya has been known to turn on the wielder instead.

One in ten osenyas will be more powerful and have Damage Reversal ability."

-- Sudjaya ---------------------------------------------------------------------------


#newmonster 7002 -- The Sudaye are the emissaries of the Usud, and bestow fate in his name
#name "Sudjaya"
#female
#descr "Demon-spirits of fate, sudjaye determine the future of newborn children. On the third night after a child is born, three Sudjaye come to visit it and seal the child's fate. The oldest of the three sudjaye, wicked and haggish, will usually propose great illness or death. The second sudjaya, younger and less wicked, will advocate for a fate less harsh, one of moderate shortcomings and suffering, while the third, still noble and beautiful, wwill advocate for a long and fruitful life. In the end, the three sudjaye often compromise. 
Like many Svarogian demons, the sudjaye are fickle. Seeking to avert an unfavorable fate, an infant's kin will leave offerings for the fate-weavers in the form of wine, honeyed cakes, coins, and basil. Sometimes, frightened by the capriciousness of the fate-weavers and the unknowable fate which will be imposed on the child, a worried mother might try to trick the fate-weavers by hiding the child and placing a doll in the cot instead. If paid proper respect or placated by the offerings, the sudjaye might bless a child with good health and an unburdened life. However, if they are displeased or offended, it is not uncommon the child dies soon afterwards."

-- White Vila ------------------------------------------------------------------------


#newmonster 7003
#name "White Vila"
#female
#descr "A vila may dwell in clouds, mountains, rivers and lakes, or other clandestine places. Usually they appear as beautiful maidens, naked or dressed in white with long flowing hair. They are just, benevolent and well-disposed towards mortals unless provoked, and especially kind to young girls and warriors wounded in battle. While seeing one is considered a good omen, woe betide those who anger them, for they may perish from but a single glance. Many a tale speaks of vengeful vilas who steal children, curse and maim, or even demand human sacrifice to placate their whims. According to legends, they are eternally young and the source of their everlasting youth lies within their hair. Should one pluck but a single strand, a vila would die. Their power, on the other hand, is contained within their magical mantle, and one may gain control of a vila by stealing a piece of it. A vila’s voice is as beautiful as the rest of her, and one who hears it may lose all thought of food, drink or sleep for days. Despite their feminine charms, however, vilas are fierce warriors. When they battle, the earth is said to shake. They ride on horses or deer when they hunt with their bows and arrows and will kill any man who defies them or breaks his word. Fairy circles of deep thick grass are left where they have danced, and treading on them will bring bad luck. Vilas' most striking attribute, however, is their freedom. They are free from both of the great inevitabilities, that of death - like mortal - and that of eternal life - like gods. Vilas decide when they shall die and when they shall be born again - a freedom no other creature has. When dew from rain that pours under the rainbow while the sun shines collects on red flowers, a vila may choose to be born again. Their greatest weakness is reflected in their tendency to fall in love with mortals who may in turn attempt to take advantage of their affection by stealing their powers. 

Vilas receive a 25% rebate while Mother Oak is active."

They usually live deep inside the Dark Forest, where they ply their wicked trade, though at times they may choose to remain in the villages of their birth where they spread sorrow and strife in secret. There are but two ways to become a veshtica. One must either be born a mora, marry, and then ritually slay a kinsman by eating their heart. Alternatively, an ancestor not given proper burial rites by her kin may rise from her grave as a veshtica and come back to plague the village. Strife and sorrow follow in their wake. Veshticas subside on a diet of human liver and heart which they cut out from the chests of sleeping victims with a rusty sickle. If a Veshtica is slain she will burst into a cloud of disease-ridden fumes, infecting her killer and anyone nearby with disease."

Most warriors carry primitive weapons such as axes, and more accessible leather armor.  Though poor in arms, a land such as Svarogia - where fate and destiny are all - is rich in great heroes who are often aided and granted enchanted weapons and armor by some of the less wicked spirits of the wild. While great heroes typically die tragically and are soon resigned to memory, such arms, imbued with powerful magics, persist, and are passed down from generation to generation. Those who inherit or come to possess such items have come to be known as the ancestral warriors and are believed to carry the favor of both their ancestors and the spirits of the wilds.

#descr "'As for me today, so to them forever.'

It is said that in a distant land, beyond the forests, across the rivers, and over the mountains, there is a peculiar place, an opulent palace adorned with all the worldly riches that constantly keeps diminishing in grandeur each night until it finally becomes nothing more than a dilapidated hut unfit for a street beggar, before it turns back into a grand palace once more. In this otherworldly residence lives the Usud, the Arbiter of Fate, and the lord of the demon-spirits of fate, the Sudjaye.
The Usud bestows his own fate to those who were born that day according to how well he lived the same day. All people know if one has nothing but ill-fortune in life, that they were born at an unfortunate time when the Usud's home was nothing but a hut, and try as they might, they cannot change their rotten fate and misfortune. In the same fashion, those who enjoy a life of comfort and ease, regardless of their ambition, or lack thereof, are known to have been born when the Usud's home was a grand palace, and subsequently great fortune always follows them.
The very presence of the Usud is heretical to pretender gods who seek to rule the fates of men, for once one's fate has been determined by the Usud, no other power can change it, even that of gods.

In any land the Usud dwells, either a good or a bad event will happen each month."

And by their masters nine grim wolves.
There howled their grief the nine grim wolves,
And there whined the nine good battle-horses,
And in sorrow screamed nine keen-eyed falcons.
But the mother's heart was hard within her,
Hard the mother's heart, and dry her eyelids.
And she lead away the nine good horses,
And with them lead the nine grim wolves,
Called to her the nine keen-eyed falcons,

With his vile soul unable to leave his body, the Old Miller rose anew in undeath and with a taste for human blood at that. At first, he preyed upon those who would occasionally come to his mill to grind flour. But over time, as the disappearances mounted the visitations weakened, and the Old Mill gained a sinister reputation. Now, centuries later, while the legend of the Old Mill remains, its location is lost to time, though most still know to avoid a particular part of land lest they disappear too and to not mention the Miller lest they summon him."

#descr "Legend has it that Svarogia gains a new Zmay once a year, when a blinding fiery ball rises into the sky, and bursts into an explosion of sparks exactly at midnight, banishing the darkness, and lighting the night sky. From those sparks a Zmay is born. A Zmay may come in many shapes and forms. Some appear with a ram's head, some with a falcon's head, or elongated snake bodies. Other may yet have a carp's scales, though all share a lizard's form. A Zmay is a solar being sent to protect the lands of Svarogia and to drive away the glutenous ala which would devour the Sun itself, and plunge the world into darkness. While Zmays are considered truly good beings, they are not without faults and have been known to lust after beautiful maidens. From such a coupling, Zmay-children are born. A smitten Zmay might even forget and neglect its main duties - looking after the crops of his protectorate by warding off bad weather and storm bringing alas, which then inevitably plague the villages under his protection. Women, on the other hand, cannot easily handle the great love of a Zmay, and they begin to lose strength, to wilt and wither and must free themselves if they are to survive."

A smitten Zmay might even forget and neglect its main duties - looking after the crops of his protectorate by warding off bad weather and storm bringing alas, which then inevitably plague the villages under his protection. Women, on the other hand, cannot easily handle the great love of a Zmay, and they begin to lose strength, to wilt and wither and must free themselves if they are to survive."

#descr "In many parts of Svarogia, ancient wolf totems carved from great oaks may still be found, hailing back to a far less civilized time, long before the creation of the Svarogian kingdom, when the she-wolf gave birth to the first Svarogian. Being descended from them, Svarogians venerate their ancestors by carving totems, or leaving offerings in the wild. Animals slaughtered by wolves are considered to have been ordained for slaughter by the Lame Wolf, who once a year calls upon all the wolves of Svarogia, and rules what is to be slaughtered and eaten by each wolf that year. 

The wolf totem will summon nearby wolf packs to aid Svarogians during battle."

#descr "An azhdaya is a foul creature resembling a gigantic snake that lives in large bodies of water, where it await for passers-by and devours them. It is hideous to behold and creates an infernal racket with its dreadful shrieks. Her hide is so thick that arrows will bounce off it, making it difficult to kill or even wound one. The voraciousness of an azhdaya is terrible for they are insatiable and their appetite surpasses even that of an ala. A legend as old as Svarogia tells that once upon a time the lands of Svarogia were graced with not one, but three suns, but then an azhdaya so glutenous appeared that she climbed the high mountains behind which the three suns rose and swallowed two of them. A falcon and a lizard noticed this however, and decided to save the third sun before the azhdaya could swallow it and plunge the world into darkness. The brave lizard attacked the azhdaya, biting its tail and distracting it while the falcon moved the sun away from the azhdaya's reach.

Azhdayas are terrible beings and may only be killed by cutting off all of their heads, and swiftly. Should one fail to kill an azhdaya, she will grow stronger for it and grow new heads from her wounds."

Such a malevolent entity is typically formed from the souls of deceased individuals who were not given proper burials, though there are other means of creating such a creature. The fear of the vampir has led to the widespread veneration of ancestors in Svarogia and the birth of the Cult of the Ancestor in the hopes of preventing the rise of such spirits. Vampirs are hideous creatures, bloated and rotted, though they may also take the form of a werewolf. Although they are immortal, they never stop aging and deteriorating. It is believed that the corpse is nothing more than a puppet and that the spirit takes the form of a butterfly that resides within the corpse and animates it. When a vampir is slayed, special care must be taken to kill the butterfly which emerges from its mouth, or the vampir will not be truly vanquished and may animate another corpse."

#newmonster 7023
#copyspr 591 -- Dragonrfly
#name "Butterfly"
#descr "In many parts of Svarogia people are still given to the cleansing flame after death, for if there is no body for a spirit to inhabit, then it cannot rise after death. A vampir is such a spirit which inhabits the body of a deceased person and animates it in a perversion of life. Such a malevolent entity is typically formed from the souls of deceased individuals who were not given proper burials, though there are other means of creating such a creature. The fear of the vampir has led to the widespread veneration of ancestors in Svarogia and the birth of the Cult of the Ancestor in the hopes of preventing the rise of such spirits. Vampirs are hideous creatures, bloated and rotted, though they may also take the form of a werewolf. Although they are immortal, they never stop aging and deteriorating. It is believed that the corpse is nothing more than a puppet and that the spirit takes the form of a butterfly that resides within the corpse and animates it. When a vampir is slayed, special care must be taken to kill the butterfly which emerges from its mouth, or the vampir will not be truly vanquished and may animate another corpse."

#descr "The Todorats' are dark horsemen whose thunderous approach strikes fear into the hearts of those who hear it. Their true name has been lost to history due to the fear of summoning them, and they are considered among the most powerful and cruel entities in Svarogia. These demons appear as if they have grown out of horses' backs, and wear cloaks that billow behind them as they charge through the night. No one has ever seen their faces, which only adds to their eerie and mysterious nature. Thankfully, the Todorats' make their appearance but once a year. Near the end of winter, when darkness descends, one may wake to the sound of approaching hooves which can be heard from a great distance, striking fear into the hearts of villagers. As they rampage down the roads between the settlements, they leave a path of destruction, trampling and killing everything in their wake with their deadly hooves. The Great Todor, their leader, is unique among the Todorats'. He rides a white horse, is draped in a white sheet, and is lame."

It enjoys engaging in terrifying and violent acts, preying on both women and men. Women are often the victims of brutal torture which last throughout the night and results in grave bodily harm through disfigurement, drowning, or being thrown from hilltops. The terror only subsides at dawn when the victim is released from the grasp of the demon. Men are targeted differently, as the karakondzula will ride them, draining their strength and ultimately causing exhaustion and eventually death. These demonic creatures are greatly feared. Such acts of violence instill great fear and unrest in the communities where a karakondzula is present."

However, some suspect him to be something more than a simple hero. An ancient legend says that once upon a time, The Man on the White Horse was the weakest of all of his father's numerous children; a frail, sickly, and limp child. Even the foal he rode was just as feeble as him and barely capable of supporting his skeletal frame. Deemed too weak to receive his father's boons and tend to the sacred duties required of him, his sibling trapped him and his foal in a deep, dark cave, and left them for dead. There, on the brink of death, they were found by a vila who nursed them back to health over the course of a long night. In the morning, both the child and the foal emerged from the cave stronger than ever, all of their ailments gone, except the distinct limp. Ever since, The Man on the White Horse has championed the weak and the helpless, dying and being reborn countless times to protect and aid those in need. Upon death, he returns to his cavernous grave to rest and rejuvenate, emerging once again with the coming of Spring, when the sun and the rain return."

While blessed with the great physical prowess and virtue of a zmay, and privy to all the secrets of a world hidden from mortal, they yet remain mortal themselves, being of both worlds, but belonging to neither. Though their time on the Terrestrial sphere is often short, shorter than that of most mortals, and though it always ends tragically and violently, the light of their life burns all the more brightly for it and banishes away darkness and evil."

#selectnation 314
#name "Svarogia"
#epithet "Dark Forests"
#era 2 -- 2
#descr "Svarogia is a hard and unforgiving land abound with capricious and mercurial demonic spirits which roam the land freely, sometimes offering aid and guidance to the people, while other times punishing or killing them according to their whim. In such a cruel place, those who are weak or careless quickly fall prey to one of the many dangers that lurk at every turn. As a result, Svarogians have gained a measure of wisdom over the years, and have become a hardened people, stronger and more resilient than most. Those who live to survive to adulthood, at least. In a land beset by so many dangerous spirits, tradition is paramount, and the people know that neglecting proper rituals can have dire consequences. Those who observe the correct customs and practices may find the spirits are more favorably disposed towards them, making their lives easier and sometimes reaping benefits from appeasing the spirits.
Armor of high quality is a rare commodity in Svarogia and is usually reserved for seasoned warriors or those in the service of wealthy and influential knyazi. Consequently, people have learned to rely on their own skills and cunning to stay alive in this challenging world. 
Despite the hardships, Svarogia is a land of great beauty, with towering mountains, dense forests, and deep, dark caverns. It is a place of mystery and wonder, filled with clandestine places where ancient spirits still hold sway, and the old ways still hold meaning."
#summary "Race: Humans and demonic spirits. Can recruit Wolfkin and Haiduk in forests. Prefers Cold scale +1.
Military: Archers, light cavalry, light and medium infantry. Stealthy Wolfkin and Haiduks. Sacred infantry with magic greatswords.
Magic: Air, Astral, Death, Nature, Glamour and Blood.
Priests: Weak.
Magic Sites: May gain magic sites with unique monsters. Vitor Mountain site changes location every few months and has to be rediscovered."
#brief "Svarogia is a cold, forested realm, home to a tribe of hardened humans and a myriad of demonic spirits. Its military uses light armor, but features unique troops and summons."

This plea to the angelic beings that watch over their descendants cannot be made until the very brink of battle, for only those who about to die and are willing to sacrifice themselves to purge the forces of evil from the Terrestrial Sphere are ever granted this holy power."

They gather in tightly knit bands and travel the world, seeking out darkness and corruption wherever it may fester. Each band is a community of shared purpose, strengthened by collective prayers, rituals, and their sacred duty. Zealots are known to hold sermons in the villages they pass through, often inspiring others to join their cause or offer aid.
Though their zeal is a great source of strength, it may also be their greatest flaw for the Zealots often lack nuance in their judgment and their fervor may lead them to act with reckless abandon. To them, there are no shades of gray, only the righteous and the wicked. This uncompromising worldview makes them revered among some groups, but feared fanatics among many others.

#descr " Trained by Archonian priests in secluded sanctuaries, Wardens undergo many years of grueling preparation, both physical and spiritual. Their training hones not only their combat skills but also their ability to channel divine power. Through faith and discipline, they learn to wield the holy arts, and conjure holy bolts to smite their foes with. These bolts burn away the corrupted essence of those struck, reducing lesser demons and undead entities to ash, while leaving even the more powerful ones scarred. The divine power the Wardens wield may also cause harm to mortals, and has been known to kill in some instances. The greater a soul's wickedness, the more harm the holy power will inflict.
While their abilities are formidable, the path of a Warden is one of sacrifice. They are bound to lives of isolation and ceaseless duty, forgoing personal ties and worldly comforts to serve a higher purpose. Wardens are often misunderstood by common folk, who fear their divine judgment. Villages may welcome a Warden’s arrival with both hope and trepidation, unsure whether their hidden sins might be revealed in the Warden’s gaze."

#descr "Not all angels were banished during the Sundering. Some were caught in the midst of the ritual, their essence fragmented, leaving them unable to ascend to the Celestial Realm, nor endure in the mortal world without perishing. Forced to shed their divinity in order to survive, these angels became mere echoes of their former glory, stripped of much of their power and purpose, retaining but a sliver of their divine grace.
Astras are such diminished angels, beings of haunting beauty and sorrow. They manifest as striking figures with otherworldly and ethereal features, tinged with a faint sorrow that speaks of their fall from celestial perfection. While Astras they wear no armor, their presence still radiates a fragile yet awe-inspiring strength, and few would dare strike at such beings. They wield enormous flaming swords, weapons of divine fire that scorch all who are struck. These blades are their last connection to the celestial power they once wielded, burning with a purity that cannot be extinguished by any means. The Astras are eternally tethered to the mortal plane, and hope to one day regain their lost grace."

This training focuses as much on mental fortitude as on martial skill. A Paladin’s mind must be a fortress, unshaken by fear, doubt, or temptation. As a result, Paladins are renowned for their unwavering courage and incorruptible integrity, capable of standing firm even in the face of overwhelming evil.
This knightly order has a longstanding tradition of passing down armaments. Weapons and armor from fallen - or in rare instances retired - Paladins are bestowed upon their successors. Some say that it is the spirits of the departed which linger within these relics that impart the new bearers with an unshakable resolve, rather than any mental training.
Paladins ride upon proud, battle-hardened steeds, bred for their strength, speed, and discipline. These noble mounts, adorned with shimmering barding inscribed with holy symbols, are trained to remain calm in the chaos of battle and to charge fearlessly into the fray."

Recognizing the significance of this lingering power, the Archonian priesthood erected the Temple of Light, a sacred sanctuary where this residual celestial power could be channeled into a select group of warriors.
Thus was the Order of the Avengers formed at the hallowed temple - a brotherhood of warriors forged through years of rigorous training, bound to the Light. Avengers wield twin broadswords blessed by the temple's high priests, said to glow radiantly in the dark. In battle, they move like a storm, their luminous blades a whirlwind of motion, wielded with fluid grace and efficiency.
The true power of the Avengers, however, is not rooted in their masterful swordplay, but rather in the divine aegis placed upon them. When an Avenger is faced with certain death in battle, the divine aegis intercedes and preserves them, granting them a second chance at life.
But this divine power is not without limits, however, not a permanent gift. It is fleeting, tied to their deeds and inner purity. The divine aegis must be continually sustained through acts of valor and righteousness. Should one falter in courage, stray from their path, or betray their sacred purpose, this divine power will fade from their being, rendering them unworthy and even causing immense pain which may result in death. This ensures that Avengers are chosen not only for their martial prowess but for their ability to embody courage, sacrifice, and unwavering devotion to the Light.

Avengers will suffer harm if they break in battle and flee, resulting in death if their Divine Aegis is gone.

While Exemplars might not be the most powerful of the angels, they are certainly the most holy and virtues, and greatest of spirit. It is for this very reason that the Exemplars cannot be summoned into the mortal realm through various rituals unlike other angels. The Portal of Radiance may only be opened but for a brief moment and only by those pure of heart and through the greatest act of selflessness, self-sacrifice and martyrdom.
Much like all angelic beings, Exemplars too are unable to contain their greatness inside mortal vessels, and are thus much diminished in the mortal realm. Their wispy, tendrilous wings of pure white light are unable to carry them through the air, but rather surround them in a nimbus of greatness. Such is the holiness of the Exemplars that sinners will repent in their presence and turn away from their evil and misguided deeds.

A Martyr Saint must be present in the province in order to recruit Exemplars and the dominion value must be at least 9."

Their celestial origin marks them as sacred beings to most peoples, and a symbol of grace and purity.
These divine steeds are the chosen battle mounts of the Archonians, who alone have proven worthy and noble enough to ride them. To ride a pegasus is to wield the favor of the celestials, a privilege afforded to only the most valorous."

#descr "The Pegasi Queens are the rulers of the Azure Cliffs, a sacred region where the noble pegasi reside. The title of queen is not inherited but earned through a grueling trial of both physical and spiritual fortitude. To ascend to this position, an aspiring queen must undertake the perilous climb of the Azure Cliffs – a treacherous and nearly impossible ascent meant to test one’s resolve and endurance. Upon scaling its jagged, windswept heights and reaching the summit, she must engage in a sacred communion with the ruling pegasus, a creature of divine wisdom and grave. The communion is a test of spirit, requiring her to demonstrate worthiness and humility. If the communion is accepted, the bond is sealed, and she is crowned queen and entrusted with the stewardship of the pegasi and the sacred cliffs."

Spell-Breakers are warrior-mages who channel the Light to weave powerful protective enchantments, shielding their allies from hostile magic and nullifying the arcane abilities. Unlike traditional mages who favor scholarly pursuits, Spell-Breakers thrive on the battlefield, fighting alongside Archonian soldiers in the front lines where their magic can have the greatest impact.
Highly disciplined and battle-hardened, they are adept not only at casting spells but also at close combat. Armed with specially crafted spin blades—circular weapons designed for both defense and offense—Spell-Breakers excel at combining spell-weaving with magical expertise.

Soldiers standing close to the Spell Breaker at the start of the battle will have their magic resistance tempered."

These fragments of the Light were harnessed in unique ways, leading each order to dedicate itself to a distinct aspect of this holy energy.
Bright Wizards wield the Light as a purifying force, summoning divine flames to cleanse the world of corruption and unholy creatures. As such Bright Wizards seldom devote their time to the study of the arcane arts but rather spend their time accompany armies into battle, crusading, and seeking purging the forces of darkness."

#descr "The three magical orders of Archonia—those of the Valkyries, Bright Wizards, and Spell-Breakers—were established in the wake of the Sundering, when fragments of divine power reshaped Archonian lands and infused them with the Light. Each order harnessed this divine power in distinct ways, dedicating themselves to specific aspects of its vast potential.
Spell-Breakers are warrior-mages who channel the Light to weave powerful protective enchantments, shielding their allies from hostile magic and nullifying the arcane abilities. Unlike traditional mages who favor scholarly pursuits, Spell-Breakers thrive on the battlefield, fighting alongside Archonian soldiers in the front lines where their magic can have the greatest impact.
Highly disciplined and battle-hardened, they are adept not only at casting spells but also at close combat. Armed with specially crafted spin blades—circular weapons designed for both defense and offense—Spell-Breakers excel at combining spell-weaving with magical expertise.

Soldiers standing close to the Spell Breaker at the start of the battle will have their magic resistance tempered."

When opened, this portal radiates with the brilliance of the heavens, casting a divine light that washes over the battlefield as the veil between realms parts, and angels—beings of pure celestial essence—descend to stand with the faithful. 
Yet, the Gate is inherently unstable and will remains open only long enough for a few angels to pass through, their numbers hopefully sufficient to turn the tide of the battle. As quickly as it appears, the Gate closes, leaving the battlefield with a fading trace of divine light and a sense of holy purpose bestowed upon those who stood in its glow."

#descr "Titans are ancient Archonian warriors of immense physical strength and towering stature, believed to have descended from a lineage of particularly powerful angels who once graced the mortal realm. Unlike other Archonians, Titans retain more pronounced angelic traits; imposing stature, heightened resistance to magic, and faintly luminous eyes that hint at their divine heritage. 
They are tragically few in number—a consequence of their bloodline diluting over countless generations. As the divine essence of their ancestors’ wanes through mortal unions, fewer Titans are born with each passing century. Some scholars in Archonia have suggested that the original angelic power was never meant to persist indefinitely in the mortal world and that the Titans are doomed to extinction.
Today, Titans are revered as symbols of Archonia's former glory, often called upon in times of great peril. Their sheer presence on the battlefield inspires awe, as they stride into combat adorned in heavy plate armor and wielding colossal maces capable of shattering stone and steel alike. However, their ever-dwindling numbers are a sobering reminder of their fragile legacy. Efforts to preserve their lineage have proven fruitless, leaving the Titans as living relics—a dying breed of warriors who embody the grandeur and the fading brilliance of their angelic ancestry."

Once inhabitants of the mortal plane, they were banished during the Sundering - an ancient cataclysm brought about by the hubris and ambition of mortal beings – and bound to the Celestial realm, a realm beyond mortal comprehension. The Sundering fractured the cosmic fabric and created a barrier that prevents angels from entering the mortal realm freely. To manifest for more than a brief moment, they require ritualistic aid and tremendous magical power. Even then, their presence is fleeting, as they are no longer of this world and will gradually diminish the longer they remain. 
Angels are radiant in form, often appearing as ethereal women of breathtaking beauty, draped in light and adorned with celestial features that inspire awe and reverence. Their mere presence can halt armies, as few possess the courage to strike such beings, fearing divine retribution or succumbing to their overwhelming aura of sanctity.
Though their power is vast, angels are bound by the limitations of their banishment. Through continued existence in the mortal realm their divine essence will slowly unravel, eventually causing them to fade into nothingness. 
Despite this betrayal, the Celestial retain hope, believing that the Archonians, their mortal descendants, can right the wrongs of the past. Patiently, they watch from afar, subtly guiding their descendants when they can. Bound by their innate nobility, they cannot abandon mortals to their fate, even those who contributed to their banishment. They await the time when the Archonians will prove themselves worthy, heal the divide, and fulfill the ancient covenant.

Angels are radiant in form, often appearing as ethereal women of breathtaking beauty, draped in light and adorned with celestial features that inspire awe and reverence. Their mere presence can halt armies, as few possess the courage to strike such beings, fearing divine retribution or succumbing to their overwhelming aura of sanctity.
Though their power is vast, angels are bound by the limitations of their banishment. Through continued existence in the mortal realm their divine essence will slowly unravel, eventually causing them to fade into nothingness. 
Despite this betrayal, the Celestial retain hope, believing that the Archonians, their mortal descendants, can right the wrongs of the past. Patiently, they watch from afar, subtly guiding their descendants when they can. Bound by their innate nobility, they cannot abandon mortals to their fate, even those who contributed to their banishment. They await the time when the Archonians will prove themselves worthy, heal the divide, and fulfill the ancient covenant.

Angels will dwindle in power each passing month until they are but a shadow of their former glory."

#spr2 "./Confluence/LA_Archons/Arbiter1.tga"
#descr "The Arbiter is a radiant angelic being, enshrouded in a veil of resplendent light and adorned with a mantle woven from the shimmering threads of the Celestial Realm itself. She stands as an eternal sentinel at the threshold between divinity and mortality, tasked with an unyielding duty: to observe and judge the Archonians, the mortal descendants of angels who once graced the world with their presence. From the heights of her divine perch, the Arbiter watches over the Archonians across the ages, evaluating their deeds, courage, and adherence to the sacred tenets left by their celestial forebears.
Rarely does the Arbiter descend from her celestial vantage, revealing her presence only in moments of profound consequence. When she does, her gaze, burdened with the weight of countless epochs, pierces the soul, unearthing the truths hidden within. She measures the essence of Archonians against the ancient legacy they claim, weighing their worthiness with unerring precision.
To those who prove themselves worthy, she offers a rare grace—a glimpse of the Celestial Sphere and the merging of the two realms. This sacred vision serves as both a reminder and a promise: that the light of their angelic heritage endures, and that the path to rejoining the divine is not yet lost. To the unworthy, her silence is a judgement in itself, leaving them to contend with their failings in the shadow of their ancestors’ greatness."

#spr2 "./Confluence/LA_Archons/WardenPretender1.tga"
#descr "The Warden of the Shining Lands is a towering and ageless angelic figure, that stands as an eternal and penitent sentinel eternally bound to the radiant Archonian Valley of Wonders—a remnant of an age when angels dwelled in the Terrestrial Realm. His piercing golden eyes, heavy with millennia of sorrow, burn with unyielding resolve, reflecting the burden of guilt he carries. In his grasp, he wields a holy blade forged from celestial fire, its searing edge a reminder of the purity he must uphold and the duty he cannot forsake.
Once counted among the mightiest of angels, the Warden was a paragon of virtue and a trusted guide to the Archonians. During the Sundering, his faith in mortal ambition blinded his judgement. Believing the Archonians’ desire for independence to be noble, he lent his voice in favor of the ritual and allowed it to happen, failing to perceive the treachery that underpinned it. In doing so, he aided the banishment of his kin to the Celestial Realm. 
When the other angels were drawn into the new plane, in an act of penance, the Warden cast off his divine mantle, allowing his angelic essence to burn away. Now stripped of his ascension, he is bound to the Shining Lands—a land of unearthly beauty suffused with the lingering echoes of celestial light, said to hold the last remnants of divine connection. From this sanctuary, the Warden guards against corruption and ensures the Archonians stay steadfast in their pursuit of redemption, untainted by mortal failings.
Though his countenance is stern and unyielding, the Warden bears an unspoken sorrow for his complicity in the Sundering, knowing his watch will only end when the rift between the realms is mended. The Archonians revere the Warden. To them, he embodies the weight of their shared guilt and aspirations to atone and reforge the bond severed so long ago. "

#spr2 "./Confluence/LA_Archons/Anon1.tga"
#descr "Following the Sundering, the Lord of Light - then but a humble cleric – discovered ways to channel residual celestial power left in its wake. With his guidance, the Temple of Light was erected, a sacred sanctuary where tiny fragments of the Light could be harnessed and channeled into worthy individuals, granting them divine powers.
Over time and through relentless study and experimentation, the Lord of Light mastered this divine force. By channeling ever-greater fragments of the Light directly into his mortal body, he transcended mortality, becoming a living vessel of the Light. This transformation was not without consequence, however. Wielding the Light in such a way burned away much of his humanity, replacing it with an incorruptible connection to the Light and an unrelenting will to carry out its purpose.
As the embodiment of the Light, he possesses powers that far exceed those of mortal clerics or paladins, who must rely on prayer or relics to channel divine energy. The Lord of Light commands the Light and shapes it as an extension of his own being. He can heal the gravely injured, purge corruption, and even dispel darkness.
Yet, such immense power comes with a heavy cost. The Light, though bound to him, was never meant to be wielded so intimately by mortal hands and each act of divine intervention steadily consuming what remains of his mortal soul and draws him closer to his own undoing."

The portal’s radiant aura emanates warmth and comfort, a blessing to those who stand near, filling them with hope and strengthening their resolve. It is said that, in times of great need, the portal will open, allowing the angelic beings of the celestial realm to step through and intervene in mortal affairs.
Ancient scripts warn that its power is not to be invoked lightly. The magic that binds it to the celestial realm is unstable, and only the most devout may open it without consequence. Some Archonian scholars believe the portal has a will of its own, choosing when and for whom it opens, and legends tell of those who tried to force it, only to be consumed by its radiant fire. To this day, the portal remains a focal point of worship, watched over by anointed guardians, waiting for the next time its celestial light will pierce the sky once more."

#selectnation 323
#name "Archonia"
#epithet "The High Men"
#era 3
#descr "When the world was still young, angels walked freely upon the earth. Their presence brought light to the darkest corners of the world, and they helped establish the foundations of civilization, teaching mortals of wisdom, justice, and righteousness.
Among them, a few formed deep connections with humanity. Seeing the potential for greatness in the mortal soul, they chose to mingle with them. From this union, the first Archonians were born—tall and radiant humans who exuded an aura of sanctity, while retaining the passion and will of mortals.
For a time, they thrived, basking in the blessings of their divine lineage. But as generations passed, pride began to overshadow humility. Their accomplishments filled them with a growing sense of independence, and seeds of doubt spread. Were not the Archonians mighty in their own right? Why should they bow to overseers who claimed to know what was best?
This discontent culminated in a grand deception, a sacred ritual that would grant them sovereignty over their realm while honoring the angels by elevating them to a higher plane of existence. This ‘Sundering’ would create a harmonious division, granting mortals independence while angels ascended to their celestial domain.
A great conclave was called, and in the Valley of Wonders, the ritual was enacted. The sky tore open, and a radiant gateway to a new plane emerged. The angels, bound by their divine essence, were drawn inexorably into the new plane, unable to resist the pull, and it had become clear that they had been banished, not exalted, their connection and influence over the world severed.
With the angels gone, the once-enlightened Archonian society began to falter and an age of penance began. Consumed by guilt, the Archonians vowed to atone for their betrayal and prove their worth to their angelic ancestors.
Now, they strive to reclaim their lost grace through devotion, valor, and unwavering faith, guided by faint whispers from the Celestial Realm."
#summary "Race: High humans.
Military: Infantry, archers, cavalry, fliers, powerful sacreds, anti-undead troops.
Magic: Fire, Water, Astral, Glamour. No access to Death or Blood spells or blesses. Death and Blood mages are banished to Hell.
Priests: Powerful. Guardian spirits. Archonia converts conquered temples. National commanders have prophet shapes with different minor bonuses. Watcher angels appear in provinces with high unrest (min 30) and act as scouts as long as unrest remains high enough."
#brief "The realm of tall, sturdy humanoids with striking features and a radiant aura. Archons are long lived and generally and more physically and mentally fit then humans. They also possess strong anti-demon and anti-undead capabilities."

Merely sensing his presence can shatter the minds of lesser beings, inducing horrifying visions and warping their sanity. To see the King in Yellow with arcane sight and a modicum of understanding is to risk madness.

The entire world is in peril as the Void Pulse slowly shatters the barrier that separates this world from the Void. Once activated, the effects of the Void Marker cannot be stopped any other way short of destroying the Void artifact. Diamedulla must be stopped before the effects of the Void Pulse become irreparable and the encroaching Void devours the whole of the world, leaving nothing but horrors and madness in its wake. 

Each month the device is active will bring the world closer to the Void, tainting it, and drawing the attention of otherworldly horrors. Madness will continue to seep into the world from the Void until the whole of the world is as mad as those of Diamedulla who caused this misfortune.
 
Sages and Wise Men speculate that magical domes could perhaps be used to hold the worse of the artifact's effect at bay and stop those under its protection from going insane."

The mad alchemists of Diamedulla have finally figured out a way to activate the Convergence Sphere, one of the three main components of the Void Marker, and by far the most dangerous. The entire world is in grave danger as the Convergence Sphere begins to exert world-wide influence, causing rampant mutations and death across the world. More and more people begin to die from strange, cancerous growths and sickening mutations. Those who die do not stay dead for long as their bodies continue to change and transform even onto death, until they eventually rise up as horrifying abominations, the Necromorph.

Once activated, the effects of the Convergence Sphere cannot be stopped any other way short of destroying the Void artifact. Unless Diamedulla is stopped, everyone in the entire world will soon be turned into a sickening abomination!

#descr "What Nercomorphs are is not exactly clear. It has been ascertained that the presence of the Void Marker will very slowly cause degeneration to those in its proximity, causing madness and mutations over long periods of time. The inevitable outcome of such extended insidious effects are Necromorphs; mutated people who are reanimated upon death and turned into something new and abominable by all standards. The effects of the Marker are very gradual, however. Those who are killed before the Marker has had a chance to exert longer, meaningful influence, seem to be simply reanimated as zombified corpses rather than Necromorphs. 
After much research and vigorous human experimentation and trial and error, the alchemists of Diamedulla have found a way to significantly accelerate the physical and psychological degeneration and turn people into Necromorphs in specialized devices called Spawning Sacks in a matter of weeks. This discovery has led to the creation of many new secret containment facilities and laboratories all around Diamedulla.
Necromorphs are incredibly infectious. Those they slaughter will quickly rise up again and mutate at a staggering rate, reshaping and growing new limbs in a matter of moments. Such an infection would likely scour the world within weeks if not for the instability of these rampant mutations, causing the infected to die off almost as quickly as they are created. Necromorphs are extremely aggressive and will attack any uninfected organism on sight. This fortunately seems to exclude most of Diamedulla's populace as every person seems to suffer from the Void Marker's influence on some level, no matter how small or insignificant."

#descr "When the secret order of the Black Alchemists finally revealed themselves and lead a bloody revolution against the Imperium, the proletariat, the simple workers of Antikythera were promised a wonderful, glorious future; a higher purpose, an escape from the menial clockwork factories. The idyllic future envisioned by the Black Alchemist for the proletariat turned out to be closer to a nightmare, as is often the case in revolutions. Although the working conditions of the average working man have not deteriorated too significantly since the splintering of the Imperium, the working people of Diamedulla do live in constant fear under the rule of the Black Alchemists and their cultists. Those observed to under-perform in their accorded duties, or those who openly express doubts or criticisms of any kind simply vanish in the middle of the night, along with their entire families. The people of Diamedulla have been stripped of many basic freedoms once taken for granted. Even death does not offer peace, as monstrous Collectors appear to take away the bodies of the recently deceased as soon as word of their passing spreads. Failure to report a death has even recently been deemed a criminal offense.

Workers have an undead second shape."

#descr "During the upheaval that gave rise to Diamedulla, much was taken from Antikythera. Many technological innovations were stolen by the Black Alchemists and then adapted to better combat their former comrades. One such innovation was the creation of the Noxious Breath, the Diamedullan variant of the Flamethrower. Unlike the Firebots of the Imperium of Antikythera, who use heavy plate armoring with thick insulation against heat, the Noxious Infantry of Diamedulla use simple and cheap leather armor, alchemically enhanced to protect against poison. While this light armor does little to protect from either the flamethrowers of Antikythera or its other deadly weapons, the comparatively low costs needed to create the Noxious Breath and protective gear more than makes up for these vulnerabilities. 
Although the Noxious Infantry remains largely unmodified compared to the majority of the Diamedullan units, they still use 'head jars' - special containers placed over their head which further help protect against the inherent dangers of the weapons they use. Still, even such precautions can prove insufficient at times, and operating the Noxious Breath still prove fatal."

#descr "The practice of transcending human limitations did not originate in Diamedulla but Antikythera, rather, where attempts were made to combine man and clockwork machine. Initially, metallic prostheses were developed to aid veterans of war, and help ease their lives. However, as technology advanced, individuals began to integrate more and more clockwork parts into themselves, disregarding their own limbs in favor of more durable, metallic ones. Such clockwork soldiers eventually proved extremely effective in Antikytheran wars. Although Diamedulla has since pushed the boundaries of such research to new highs—or perhaps lows—exploring the darker aspects of human anatomy and physical limits, their advancements remain rooted in the original, morally questionable practices of Antikythera which would inevitably lead to the creation of all of Diamedulla's horrors. An Amalgamation is one of such horrors. It is a spider-like creature composed of numerous metallic limbs, capable of trampling lesser creatures under it, and even scaling walls."

A monster created from a ghoulish collection of severed human body parts, stitched into a single and composite form onto an unwilling test subject, typically a simple Worker. These monstrous creatures have metallic prosthetic extremities and often an uneven and unnatural number of limbs. Flesh Golems are very fast and agile. They are able to charge at their victims, bringing them down and overwhelming them with a flurry of quick and vicious attacks. Due to their rather disturbing and sickening origins, the Flesh Golems are utterly raving mad and horrifying to behold. The Flesh Golems were initially designed to serve as assassins due to their versatile skill set, however the unintended consequence of their raving madness makes them less than ideal assassins, unpredictable and prone to fits of extreme violence and bloodlust. Though they are decidedly more dangerous, they do lack the single-mindedness and patience of a typical assassin."#prot 10

These severed heads, suspended in a blend of alchemical fluids interfaces directly with the machine through mysterious bridging of magic and engineering.

Operating under the cover of darkness, Virulent Priests infiltrate foreign lands, seeking out new followers, gathering their flock in small numbers and leading them to clandestine temples, typically established in warehouses, sewers, and other such grim and unseemly places, hidden from prying eyes. In these secret places the Virulent Priests unveil the face of their god to those gathered, often turning them into the monstrous abominations. These cultists believe they are the chosen agents of the Void and its herald, the Void Marker. Their own bodies and minds have been severely warped by the Marker’s corrupting influence, granting them the ability to spread the infection further. Virulent Priests harbor the dormant properties of the Void Marker within them, which can be activated to trigger accelerated mutations, transforming them into 'Prophets of the Void. In this heightened state, a Virulent Priest becomes a harbinger of corruption, infecting all who come into contact with them, turning victims into twisted Nercomorphs and Necrobrutes. Once this accelerated mutation begins, it is irreversible. Eventually, even the Virulent Priest themselves will succumb to the potency of the infection they carry and die.

The presence of preaching Virulent Priests in their second form will spread an outbreak of Necromorphs in any land they're present in. For the outbreak to happen they must continuously preach for two to four months, at which point a Virulent Temple site will be created in the province.

#descr "The Collectors themselves are the end results of horrifying and ungodly experimentation. They are the boogeymen of Diamedulla, the monsters which wait under your bed to snatch and take you away and do unspeakable, unbearable things. Collectors often stalk individuals suspected of possessing rare traits or abnormalities. Such unfortunates are often taken under the cover of night and brought back to one of the numerous Diamedullan labs for further testing and experimentation.
At times, large-scale experiments are also conducted by the Collectors on unsuspecting population. Many people are abducted during the night, never to be seen or heard from again. At times, entire villages have been known to simply vanish without a trace. Such experiments are typically conducted covertly and far in between, less word of the disappearances spreads, causing too much unrest and driving potential test subjects into hiding, thereby hindering the successfulness of future experiments.

Collectors are capable of initiating 'experiments' through one of their innate abilities. By doing so they will attempt to locate and capture a mutated subject at the cost of some unrest and population death. The lower the unrest in a province, the higher the change the Collectors will locate a suitable ‘subject’. Only a single Collector at a time may conduct an experiment in a province."

#descr "A Spawning Sack is the birthing place of nightmares, the artificial womb of a horror. Unwilling subjects - for no other kind could possibly exist - are submerged inside the viscous fluids of the sack. Once a subject has been sealed inside the sack; long, metallic spines are then inserted, spines which connect to a vat of preservative fluids where something slithering, with far too many tentacles and sickening, fleshy protuberance is contained. Those unfortunate individuals sealed inside the Spawning Sack will mutate at an accelerated rate over a course of weeks and will emerge as inhuman monstrosities known as Necromorphs, leaving room for others to be placed inside in a repeat process.
The creature contained within the vat is an aberration created by the Void Marker. A simple individual who was affected by the insidious hum of the Marker to a much higher degree than is normal, causing them to mutate into something completely non-human and tumorous-looking. The discovery of such a remarkable specimen has shifted the focus to locating other such test subjects with unique or rare properties who might aid the research of the Void Marker."

	#descr "What Nercomorphs are is not exactly clear. It has been ascertained that the presence of the Void Marker will very slowly cause degeneration to those in its proximity, causing madness and mutations over long periods of time. The inevitable outcome of such extended insidious effects are Necromorphs; mutated people who are reanimated upon death and turned into something new and abominable by all standards. The effects of the Marker are very gradual, however. Those who are killed before the Marker has had a chance to exert longer, meaningful influence, seem to be simply reanimated as zombified corpses rather than Necromorphs. 
After much research and vigorous human experimentation and trial and error, the alchemists of Diamedulla have found a way to significantly accelerate the physical and psychological degeneration and turn people into Necromorphs in specialized devices called Spawning Sacks in a matter of weeks. This discovery has led to the creation of many new secret containment facilities and laboratories all around Diamedulla.
Necromorphs are incredibly infectious. Those they slaughter will quickly rise up again and mutate at a staggering rate, reshaping and growing new limbs in a matter of moments. Such an infection would likely scour the world within weeks if not for the instability of these rampant mutations, causing the infected to die off almost as quickly as they are created. Necromorphs are extremely aggressive and will attack any uninfected organism on sight. This fortunately seems to exclude most of Diamedulla's populace as every person seems to suffer from the Void Marker's influence on some level, no matter how small or insignificant."

Unlike the alchemists of Diamedulla, the Flesh Carverns are not mad - at least, not in any conventional sense.

#descr "An Enlightened Madman is the rare, unsettling product of a Mad Alchemist who has drank so deeply from the wellspring of madness that they reach a state of distorted clarity. Unlike their peers, who are swallowed entirely by chaos, Enlightened Madmen emerge from their descent into madness with a twisted sense of purpose. In their deluded minds, they believe they’ve unlocked the ultimate truths of the universe—insights so profound that no one else can comprehend them. This belief drives them to act with terrifying conviction, as their every action seems guided by a vision only they can perceive.
Though their minds are fragmented beyond repair, Enlightened Madmen possess an unsettling lucidity in their madness. They speak in cryptic riddles and paradoxes, blending brilliance with incoherence, and many believe their insights could hold the key to unraveling the deepest mysteries of the Void. Their connection to the Void Marker is stronger than that of any other, and time itself seems to bend around them, as if they are perpetually one step ahead, perceiving moments and possibilities beyond the comprehension of lesser minds. Yet, their clarity is but another form of madness, one so profound that it becomes indistinguishable from enlightenment."

#descr "The Black Alchemists are the mad, abusive fathers of Diamedulla. They were once alchemists of Antikythera who either fell victim to the Void Marker's influence or became utterly captivated by its mysteries. Obsessed with the study of this anomalous artifact, their fixation eventually led to a civil war that split the Imperium in twain. Once the Void Marker was first discovered in Antikythera and put to study, the strange properties of the artifacts were soon made evident: those in its proximity slowly succumbed to insanity, their minds warped and twisted in unimaginable ways. Before long a decision was made to abandon its mysteries and destroy the Void Marker before its damage became irreparable. However, the alchemists fascinated by it—or perhaps already mad from its influence—rebelled at the prospect of destroying such a wonder, leading a revolution that fractured the Imperium in two parts locked in constant bloodshed and destruction. Whether the Black Alchemists were always somewhat mad, their insanity simply veiled under the eccentricity often associated with their profession, or whether they truly went mad from interacting with the Void Marker is unknown and ultimately irrelevant.  

The Void Marker will continue to exert a malevolent influence on the Black Alchemists, gradually eroding their sanity. As Black Alchemists observe the passing of time as slowed, due to the Temporal Clocks they use, their actions consequently seem quickened. As such, Black Alchemists are capable of casting spells much faster than normal."

#name "Viral Specimen Tank"
#spr1 "./Confluence/LA_Diamedulla/GreenTank1.tga"
#spr2 "./Confluence/LA_Diamedulla/GreenTank1.tga"
#descr "The Viral Containment Tank contains a specimen which possesses a very rare trait. It is capable of causing powerful and rampant, yet stable mutations in those directly infected by it. It is still unknown exactly what traits and characteristics are requisite in a subject for successful transformation as some experiments seem to succeed remarkably, while others, with a seemingly identical group, on occasion fail to produce almost any results. Whatever the case may be, a successful experiment does seem to require a critical biomass. Typically, around one hundred Workers are needed for a successful experiment, sometimes less, and sometimes more, depending on the quality of the subjects themselves. Once infected, these Workers will rapidly mutate and merge - often violently, piercing and slashing at each other and growing into the bodies of those impaled - into a new class of Necromorphs called Necrobrutes due to their imposing size. A successful experiment will produce anywhere between fifteen and thirty Necrobrutes, often leaving a few excess Zombified Workers in their midst as well.

Typically, once a Necromorph is created, its mutations cease, and its sole purpose becomes the creation of more infected bodies and horrifying creatures. However, with the aid of a Parasyte, the twisted Black Alchemists can reactivate the mutation process in several Necromorphs each month. This feat is particularly valuable, as reintroducing Necromorphs to lab conditions safely is an arduous and time-consuming process. The Parasyte's influence allows for the continuous evolution of these abominations.

The Larval Specimen Tank appears to affect only Virulent Priests, further cementing their delusions of being divinely chosen to serve as priests of the Void, heralding its arrival. When Virulent Priests come into contact with this specimen, they undergo a transformation into Virulent Emissaries—more infectious and potent versions of themselves with enhanced priestly powers. This mutation significantly increases their ability to spread their dark influence and further the aims of the Void.

#descr "These tattered pages are filled with the cryptic writings and forbidden insights of those who have lost their minds to the Void. The disjointed scrawlings are a mix of genius and madness, revealing hidden truths about arcane power that no sane mind was meant to grasp. However, the more one studies these notes, the more their own thoughts begin to unravel, and an eerie presence seems to loom just beyond the edge of awareness. Prolonged use will inevitably draw the attention of otherworldly horrors, entities that lurk in the spaces between realms, waiting for minds cracked open by forbidden knowledge."

Of those, Recombinant stand out as some of the most sickening and horrifying creations. These are once-human souls impaled on sinister devices known as ‘Dragon's Teeth’. Despite their grisly fate, the Recombinant remain alive and painfully conscious for an extraordinarily long time while slowly being twisted and turned into abominations over a course of agonizing weeks, or even months through vile black alchemy that permeates the very devices they are impaled upon.
Dragon's Teeth are typically placed along Diamedullan borders, and in front of their secretive fortifications, serving as both deterrents and traps for intruders. When approached, the impaling devices will slowly release the Recombinant one at a time while also injecting them with one last compound, the final, cruel touch of their deranged creators. Once released, the Recombinant will charge at their enemies and - once close enough, or near death – detonate in a powerful alchemical explosion, killing those nearby or immobilizing them with foul fumes for another Recombinant to more easily rip them apart. Fully transformed Recombinant do not retain any vestiges of their former personalities and are just mindless, empty husks."

#descr "Given free rein and an endless supply of test subjects, the Flesh Cravers have created many horrors in the nightmarish depths of Diamedulla’s secret laboratories. Of those, Recombinant stand out as some of the most sickening and horrifying creations. These are once-human souls impaled on sinister devices known as ‘Dragon's Teeth’. Despite their grisly fate, the Recombinant remain alive and painfully conscious for an extraordinarily long time while slowly being twisted and turned into abominations over a course of agonizing weeks, or even months through vile black alchemy that permeates the very devices they are impaled upon.
Dragon's Teeth are typically placed along Diamedullan borders, and in front of their secretive fortifications, serving as both deterrents and traps for intruders. When approached, the impaling devices will slowly release the Recombinant one at a time while also injecting them with one last compound, the final, cruel touch of their deranged creators. Once released, the Recombinant will charge at their enemies and - once close enough, or near death – detonate in a powerful alchemical explosion, killing those nearby or immobilizing them with foul fumes for another Recombinant to more easily rip them apart. Fully transformed Recombinant do not retain any vestiges of their former personalities and are just mindless, empty husks."

Dragon's Teeth are typically placed along Diamedullan borders, and in front of their secretive fortifications, serving as both deterrents and traps for intruders. When approached, the impaling devices will slowly release the Recombinant one at a time while also injecting them with one last compound, the final, cruel touch of their deranged creators. Once released, the Recombinant will charge at their enemies and - once close enough, or near death – detonate in a powerful alchemical explosion, killing those nearby or immobilizing them with foul fumes for another Recombinant to more easily rip them apart. Fully transformed Recombinant do not retain any vestiges of their former personalities and are just mindless, empty husks."

Due to this quite literally maddening obstacle, a device was created, one that could conduct the research unhindered and not fall prey to the Marker's insidious influence. 
The Deciphering Engines are towering machines created by the Black Alchemists to aid in the study of the Void Marker. Due to their enormous size, only one such engine can be operated from any single laboratory. Each Deciphering Engine constructed adds to the overall progress in uncovering the Void Marker's secrets. The more laboratories there are with Deciphering Engines, the faster the research will be conducted. So far, the Mad Alchemists have ascertained that the Void Marker can directly perform at least three separate, distinct functions, though it yet remains a mystery as to what those functions may be."

Upon discovering the insidious properties of the Marker, mainly its ability to slowly and irrevocably twist and erode the minds of those nearby, the Technomancers advocated for its destruction before its effects could devastate Antikythera entirely. Their warnings proved accurate but came too late, as a Void Cult had already formed among the ranks of the Alchemists.

Now, the Void Marker sits in the capital of Diamedulla, exerting its influence over the entire land, twisting both bodies and minds beyond measure. As such, it is little wonder that Diamedulla has turned into a nightmarish realm of horrifying creatures under the direction of mad mages and the all too eager scalpels of the Flesh Carvers.

But in his thirst for knowledge and fixation on uncovering mysteries of the strange void artifact, Arcos became ensnared by its insidious influence. 
As the Marker’s influence crept into his mind, Arcos' brilliance twisted into madness. The deeper he delved into his research, the more his mind and body began to erode, losing his grip on both reality and sanity, and warping his form into something grotesque.
Though Arcos’ immense intellect was preserved, he was corrupted and transformed by the Void Marker.
No longer recognizable as the man he once was, Arcos transformed into the Cerebellith, a grotesque floating brain surrounded by writhing tentacles capable of siphoning the life force from its victims with a single touch, and shattering lesser minds with mere thoughts. "

This enigmatic artifact predates the Void Marker, discovered by early Antikytheran scholars amid the crumbled ruins of a lost civilization, one believed to have succumbed to the influence of the void. The Precursor serves as both a guide and a warning, hinting at the immense powers contained within the Void. Initially hailed as a tool for enlightenment and discovery, it granted those who studied it glimpses of the cosmos and insights into the very fabric of reality.  
As word of the Precursor’s existence spread, it attracted the ambitious and inquisitive minds of Antikythera. Their fascination with the artifact laid the groundwork for the dark curiosity that would ultimately lead to the discovery of the Void Marker. Through subtle influence, the Precursor nudged scholars toward ever-darker explorations of the Void, setting them on a path that would eventually tear the empire apart.
While the Void Marker now reigns supreme in the capital of Diamedulla, it is the Precursor that ignited the chain of events leading to the current nightmare. Its whispers linger in the minds of those who dare to seek its knowledge, echoing a reminder that some truths are far too dangerous to uncover, and some mysteries are best left forgotten.

The Precursor has a one turn 500 research bonus, after which its research will revert to normal."

#descr "The Spawning Pool is a grotesque, pulsating mass of alien flesh and sinew, its surface slick with a foul, otherworldly secretion. This horrific organic pool serves as a birthing chamber for abominations known as necromorphs and necrobrutes, nightmarish creatures twisted beyond recognition. The Spawning Pool is not a natural entity; it is an aberration born from the sinister influence of the Void Marker. Once, it was a living being—transformed by the Marker’s corruption, warped into this revolting creation. The pool constantly writhes, releasing malformed limbs and twisted forms from its bubbling."

Their mind opens to the whispers of the Void, enabling them to cast spells and conduct research even in the most inhospitable environments. However, this powerful spell comes with significant risks. The whispers of the Void can be overwhelming, potentially leading to permanent changes in the caster's psyche, and in some cases, even madness."

Unfortunately, many Mad Alchemists and Black Alchemists refuse to practice Void Alchemy for they do not consider themselves to be mad, and thus in need of it.

#descr "With this grim procedure a Black Alchemist's head is harvested from his body post mortem and placed in a fluid container. The success rate of such a complicated and unorthodox procedure - even for Diamedullan standards - is nowhere close to guaranteed and as such roughly 30% of subjects are lost during the procedure, or within the first few weeks. This type of head transplant procedure is exceedingly difficult as it is never performed on living subjects as is the practice, but rather as a fail-safe to attempt to preserve - or rather revive - Black Alchemists who have died to unforeseen circumstances.
Though decapitating subjects and transplanting their heads onto various other beings or constructs is a common practice in Diamedulla, doing so on already dead subject, possibly days after, is far rarer. Only the Black Alchemists are privy to such secrets and they guard them closely."

#selectnation 316
#name "Diamedulla"
#epithet "Scions of Madness"
#era 3
#descr "Diamedulla is a new empire, a twisted offspring of the Antikytheran Imperium built upon a foundation of corpses, a river of blood, and, above all, madness. It is an empire centered around a mysterious Void artifact known as the Void Marker. Indeed, it was the discovery of this strange object that gave rise to Diamedulla, or rather the forming of the Void cults that would eventually spark a revolution and bring the once-great Imperium to its knees. 
By the time the insidious properties of the Void Marker were made known to the Technomancers of Antikythera, the damage had already been done. Madness had already infected the Alchemists who studied the strange artifact, initially covered under a veil of eccentricity that typically accompanied these mages who were the ones most exposed to its insidious influence. When the Technomancers finally attempted to destroy the Void Marker, the already deranged Alchemists rebelled, igniting a bloody civil war.
The ensuing civil war tore the Imperium apart, culminating in the splintering of Antikythera and the rise of a new empire ruled by the mad victors. Those who would stop at nothing to ensure their twisted vision was fulfilled for the good of all. As such it is little wonder that life in Diamedulla is far from idyllic. Indeed, what the mad envision as paradise is a grim reality for those with a sliver of sanity, though such people seem to be in ever shorter supply in Diamedulla as the insidious effects of the Void Marker continue to erode the minds of all those in it. Horrifying experiments are now secretly conducted on the working people of Diamedulla. Many a worker goes to bed only to wake up strapped to an operating table under the intense scrutiny of a Flesh Carver holding grisly instruments, or even creatures. Whispers of secret, underground laboratories and ungodly abominations spread across the empire."
#summary "Race: Augmented humans. Can locate specialized Specimen commanders via 'experiments' who grant certain bonuses/abilities. Nation starts with Void Marker which can be improved via discoverable items to exert various global effects.
Military: Various slave workers, hybrid heavy infantry, tramplers, towering goliaths of flesh and metal, mortars and gas weapons.
Magic: Earth, Astral, Death, Blood. Most national mages slowly go mad.
Priests: Weak. Can spread Necromorph infection."
#brief "Diamedulla is a newly created empire built on countless corpses and a river of blood. It is a nightmarish land that has fallen under the insidious and warping influence of the strange Void artifact known as the Void Marker. Madness rules supreme in Diamedulla, quite literally. It is a place where sickening and unimaginable experiments are performed on the unwilling population, and where horrifying abominations are created under the guidance of its rulers."

The streets are littered with unburied corpses, as no one dares approach the infected or the dead for fear of catching the sickness. The air is thick with the scent of decay, and the silence is broken only by the occasional weak cough or distant moan from the afflicted. The villagers have sealed themselves inside their homes, their windows tightly shut, hoping that the plague will pass them by. But with each day, the sickness spreads, and the village slowly descends into an eerie, unnatural quiet."

#descr "A terrible curse is laid upon the keep. Vengeful spirits awaken within its walls, their restless whispers echoing through empty corridors and their ghostly forms flickering in the darkness. Malign entities are drawn to the accursed place, haunting its recesses with their malevolent presence.
Accidents occur under suspicious circumstances—slips, falls, and inexplicable calamities. Unexplained phenomena will distort reality, making the keep’s inhabitants question their senses and sanity. Tragedy will inevitably strike, unraveling lives and relationships, claiming victims one by one as the curse grows ever stronger. However, the curse is not beyond undoing; with great effort and unwavering faith, the evil may be confronted and the keep cleansed of its malevolence."
#details "When cast on Hollowmoor forts there is a 10% chance per friendly dominion point to summon a ghost each month, and a 1% chance per dominion point to summon either a ghost commander or a mage.

When cast on enemy forts there is a 10% chance for a ghost assassination event to take place, a 10% chance for 1d6+1d3 ghosts to attack the province, 10% chance for 2d6 ghosts to attack the province, and 5% chance for 8d3 ghosts to attack the province.
There is an 8% chance per priest level preaching to negate the effects of Haunted Castle."

The effects of the curse can be particularly dangerous in situations where luck plays a significant role, such as in battle, where a single moment of bad fortune can spell disaster. Though the curse's grip is mercifully brief, its impact during that time can be disastrous."

Omens of misfortune and ill luck, merely seeing one—or worse, attempting to harm it—often heralds an impending tragedy. Nightmares are believed to have demonic heritage due to their sinister nature and the inability of mundane weapons to easily harm them. The charge of galloping Nightmares is so fearsome that it easily shatters the ranks of even the most seasoned and courageous soldiers, leaving chaos and despair in their wake."

Once valiant knights and heroes from various lands, they were devoted to bringing order and justice to the world. All the more deep-felt and bitter was their treachery when they broke their sacred oaths and duties, discarding their humanity in the process. Now, they are cursed souls, having abandoned the last vestiges of hope and redemption, fully giving in to malice, corruption, and hatred. Though the Blazing Wardens were once men, they now appear as towering skeletal giants engulfed in perpetual searing flames, a physical manifestation of the evil that has grown to gigantic proportions within their cursed souls over the long centuries. The sacred duties they once swore to uphold have now been twisted in ironic mockery as the Blazing Wardens stand vigil over the cursed and evil lands they once sought to protect the world from. Blazing Wardens carry huge flaming spheres of metal attached to chains which they wield to devastating effects. When the flaming spheres strike, they explode in a shower of fire, scorching not only their intended target but anyone nearby, leaving nothing but ash in their wake."

It wields an enormous bloody scythe which it uses to slice up its victims and bathe in their blood, performing all manners of unholy rituals and rites. Experienced and cunning hunters, Crimson Reapers can stalk their prey quietly, from the shadows, for frighteningly long amounts of time, patiently waiting for the perfect moment to strike the fatal blow and then indulge their urges. Unlike younger vampires who fall short of such discipline and are overpowered by their bloodlust, the Crimson Reapers exercise impressive restraint, ensuring each kill.

Whether they are demons, or spirits, or inanimate objects animated to life with malignant magic is unknown. What is certain, however, is that Scarecrows are horrifying creatures which revel in terrorizing their victims. Rather than outright killing, they take perverse pleasure in tormenting their prey, driving them to the brink of madness until their hearts give out. The terror they induce burns as brightly as a bonfire, becoming a beacon for the Hollows, who eagerly descend to devour the fear-filled souls.

The Scarecrows are believed to be able to distort perception of those around them, as surely that is more believable than distorting the very reality. Projected images of the Scarecrows will dance around the battlefield, jumping out and terrorizing all those around them, including allied troops."

Whatever the case may be, the end product is still the same; a bloodthirsty and gore-covered being that goes around decapitating heads with grim satisfaction, and bloody scythe in hand. The blood-soaked sight of a Pumpkin Lord is a terrifying one to behold in battle. They seem capable of commanding any type of monster and as such often lead the misfit monsters of Hollowmoor into battle under the directions of the Dark Lords. Pumpkin Lords take great delight participating in annual Autumn Harvests, when they ride into the open countrysides and farmlands, and compete in their own twisted blood sports.

Each Autumn, the Pumpkin Lords can venture out into the open plains and farmland provinces to conduct their gruesome annual Autumn Harvest, killing indiscriminately, capturing the helpless population to serve as Blood Slaves in twisted Blood rituals, and raising many Pumpkinheads from those slayed in the process. The Autumn Harvest is conducted at the height of each month of Autumn. Only a single Pumpkin Lord is needed per land, and additional ones will offer no added benefit in capturing Blood Slaves nor raising Pumpkinheads. Hunts cannot be conducted in forts.

Those killed by Pumpkin Lords have a 33% chance of rising as Pumpkinheads."

Buttressed by a harrowing life with but sparse moments of respite and contentment, they know that the grim tales of runaway children and misfortunate waifs who frequently end up boiled alive and cooked into stew in the horrifying Bubbling Cauldron are no tales at all in Hollowmoor, and if anything, are probably much milder than the distressing reality of what becomes of those who chance such a horror.
The sickening content of the great cauldron tells a disturbing end of all the souls it has consumed over the many years. Believed to have been enchanted by a particularly twisted Wizened Hag who took great delight in boiling children alive and seasoning her stew with their blood-curdling wails, the cauldron is able to move of its own dark purpose, ever looking for more ingredients, even though its owner has long since perished. It is said that the Bubbling Cauldron grows just a little bigger with every fresh chuck of meat added to its ever-swelling volume, and that those unfortunate enough to be slowly cooked by it are not released even upon their horrifying death, as the vile animation continues to simmer and slowly devour their souls for many years to come. The Bubbling Cauldron is constantly surrounded by a foul, deathly miasma of overcooked human meat, and all those who come too close to it will fall violently ill. The agonizing howls of all those wretched souls trapped within the great cauldron can be heard from many miles away, and are a dire a warning to flee as there is."

	#descr "The children of Hollowmoor are a precocious bunch, having been robbed of their childish innocence and faced with a reality no child, or indeed man, should have to face. Buttressed by a harrowing life with but sparse moments of respite and contentment, they know that the grim tales of runaway children and misfortunate waifs who frequently end up boiled alive and cooked into stew in the horrifying Bubbling Cauldron are no tales at all in Hollowmoor, and if anything, are probably much milder than the distressing reality of what becomes of those who chance such a horror.
The sickening content of the great cauldron tells a disturbing end of all the souls it has consumed over the many years. Believed to have been enchanted by a particularly twisted Wizened Hag who took great delight in boiling children alive and seasoning her stew with their blood-curdling wails, the cauldron is able to move of its own dark purpose, ever looking for more ingredients, even though its owner has long since perished. It is said that the Bubbling Cauldron grows just a little bigger with every fresh chuck of meat added to its ever-swelling volume, and that those unfortunate enough to be slowly cooked by it are not released even upon their horrifying death, as the vile animation continues to simmer and slowly devour their souls for many years to come. The Bubbling Cauldron is constantly surrounded by a foul, deathly miasma of overcooked human meat, and all those who come too close to it will fall violently ill. The agonizing howls of all those wretched souls trapped within the great cauldron can be heard from many miles away, and are a dire a warning to flee as there is."

Whether they are demons, or spirits, or inanimate objects animated to life with malignant magic is unknown. What is certain, however, is that Scarecrows are horrifying creatures which revel in terrorizing their victims. Rather than outright killing, they take perverse pleasure in tormenting their prey, driving them to the brink of madness until their hearts give out. The terror they induce burns as brightly as a bonfire, becoming a beacon for the Hollows, who eagerly descend to devour the fear-filled souls.

The Scarecrows are believed to be able to distort perception of those around them, as surely that is more believable than distorting the very reality. Projected images of the Scarecrows will dance around the battlefield, jumping out and terrorizing all those around them, including allied troops."

At times, Banshees may be seen at night as a shrouded woman, crouched beneath the trees, lamenting with veiled face, or floating past in the moonlight, crying bitterly. The sorrowful cries of these spirits are mournful beyond all other sounds on earth, and betokens certain death when heard in the silence of the night."

Ironically enough, it is exactly the Wretched that protect the remaining population from the recurring visits of the Hollows. Where their sight is common the population quickly becomes apathetic, defeated and forlorn, losing any hope for life, and the will to fight for a better morrow, for they know that their life filled with utter terror and torment can only ever be substituted for one devoid of any feeling, emotion, or love.

It seems omnipotent at times, or at least all-reaching, being able to appear anywhere in the world. The Mist is known to stretch its ghostly tendrils far and wide, at times sweeping away evil-doers and heinous villains into Hollowmoor from half a world away, but at times also indiscriminately spiriting away entire villages or towns. Those who find themselves enveloped by these seemingly natural mists soon realize they have been transported to a realm of darkness and despair. Traveling the Mist without the guidance of a Misty Ferryman is perilous, and extended journeys often end in tragedy."

As the Harvester’s time in the mortal world wanes, the Mists thicken around it, heralding its inevitable return. A ghostly fog seeps through cracks and shadows, coiling around the Harvester like spectral chains. The creature’s form begins to waver, its body fading as though dissolving into smoke. 
The reclamation is not violent but rather inexorable. An unbreakable tether pulling the Harvester back to its source. This process strips the Harvester of the strength it borrows to exist in the mortal plane, unraveling it thread by thread. The Mists absorb its, and reforms it within the depths of Hollowmoor.

#descr "Harvesters of Souls serve no other master than the Mists of Hollwomoor. They collect the souls of the wicked and ferry them back to Hollowmoor. At times, they are unleashed upon the mortal world to claim beings too powerful or elusive for the Mists to take. The Harvesters are short-lived creatures, unable to exist for long in the mortal realm before the Mists reclaim them. While their nature does not allow them to be patient hunters who stalk their prey, the Harvesters of Souls are none the less quite proficient as no weapon can truly slay them. Patience is thus unnecessary. Should one fall in battle, it will simply be revived in the Mists, only to start its hunt anew, perhaps with another Harvester in tow. Harvesters of Souls traverse distances with ease, slipping through the Mist to move swiftly and relentlessly in pursuit of their prey. 

The Harvester of Souls can only exist in the mortal world for a short duration before being reclaimed by the Mists. It may take it several months to rematerialise."

These spiteful women have been stripped of all earthly beauty and now prowl the land in a macabre parade that heralds the arrival of the Flesh Angel herself. Although condemned to a life of endless misery, the Flayed Ones do possess at least a small degree of what they silently envied about the Flesh Angel, an aura of allure and seductiveness despite their tragic appearance, which gives ordinary men both pause and disgraceful arousal.

Over the centuries, she became so consumed with safeguarding this treasure she eventually forgot what it was. Now, though the once-secure room still exists within her aged and dilapidated castle, its contents have faded into blurred silhouettes and hazy echoes, much like the Spirit of Sorrow’s own memories of what—or rather who—was locked away. Though the reliquary now holds nothing but dust, cobwebs, and an uneasy haze of sorrow, something else stirs within its depths. Faceless specters, not unlike the Hollows, roam this deep crevice of the keep, following the Spirit of Sorrow, confounding her with their haunting presence and her inability to remember their origin. The Faceless are vicious things which prey on the living. Invisible and almost immaterial, they slip through solid matter with ease."

Sharing in his ambition—and perhaps yearning for a share of his immortality—they ensured his decrees were fulfilled no matter the cost, even as the kingdom crumbled around them and the people perished constructing the monument.
In life, they wielded authority and commanded respect, but in death, they are hollowed relics of their former selves, animated by the cursed power of the Mists of Hollowmoor. Their shriveled forms are tightly wrapped in ancient, tattered bindings, and their desiccated skin bears the marks of the years they spent serving their Pharaoh’s vision. Ghostly light flickers faintly in their sunken eyes, a reflection of souls torn from peace and condemned to eternal torment. These mummies are bound to the Pharaoh’s pyramid, eternally protecting its halls and carrying out their cursed master’s will."

#descr "The Impaler was once but a common man, a mere footman in the army of a great emperor. Through remarkable valor and resourcefulness, he earned the respect of his fellow soldiers and quickly rose to the rank of a minor lord. His new title came with the thankless task of defending the war-torn borderlands between the empire and its age-old rival—a duty he performed with exceptional skill for years, even as imperial support dwindled and the pretentious aristocracy plotted against him and ridiculed his common ancestry. His prowess and the vigor with which he sought to protect the common people of the land earned him the hatred of enemies across the border and jealousy from his supposed allies. Fearing the young lord’s growing popularity, the emperor sent him to negotiate a peace treaty with their arch-nemesis, unaware that he would in fact be part of the peace accord. Betrayed by his own countrymen, he was shackled like an animal, beaten, and tortured for a full year. Yet his spirit never broke. It remained so until the day his enemies, the lords, ladies, and emperors of both realms -those who so wished to see him broken and humiliated - presented him with the still-twitching sight of his impaled family. The young lord broke free from his shackles that day, and a dark shadow fell upon both empires. Much transpired in the following years, all of it horrifying and sickening to the core. Impaled corpses littered the landscape of both crumbling realms, and the Impaler's power had become such that those impaled could not stop their wails of agony even in their death. 

The Impaler is exceptionally skilled at pillaging provinces and can create horrid creatures known as the Impaled that continue their wails of torment well into death while doing so."

#descr "Though the Baroness may appear the least dreadful and terrifying of the Dark Lords, her malevolence far surpasses that of her more monstrous counterparts. As the youngest and only female heir in a lineage of competitive siblings, she defied societal norms by rejecting traditional feminine pursuits, picking up the sword instead of the much-expected needle and twine, much to the dismay of the court and her royal parents. From a very tender age the Baroness displayed an exceptional aptitude for swordplay and military strategy, her talent surpassing that of her many brothers. Despite her unique gifts and promise of greatness, her aspirations were met with fierce resistance from the court and her own family, who sought to stifle her ambitions and sequester her from her foolish dreams. Undeterred by the scorn of her social circle, she pursued her interests in unlikely and unsavory places for somebody of her status, becoming a social pariah, an outcast shunned and ridiculed by her peers. Even among the commoners, she was scorned and considered a laughing stock, her skill and propriety always being brought into question. When the old emperor passed away, and a power struggle ensued among his sons, the foolish girl obsessed with swordplay that did nothing but bring shame to the royal family was thrown out of the palace and stricken from everyone's mind. Consumed by hatred and rejection, she embraced her darkest desires, unleashing a torrent of destruction and bloodshed upon her royal family. Clad in a blood-soaked dress and wielding a sword, she ascended the empire’s throne before the Mists took her.

No weapon that Baroness ever picked up was for long left unmastered by her. She is believed to even be able to manipulate the very Mists of Hollowmoor, and use them to conceal her troops, and keep them hidden from enemy scouts."

#descr "The Death Knight is one of the Dark Lords of Hollowmoor. According to ancient records, the Death Knight was once a valiant prince of a small realm, happily married to a beautiful princess renowned for her gift of foresight, with whom he awaited a child. One fated night, the princess dreamt of a terrible cataclysm that would tear the kingdom apart, one only her beloved could prevent, though it would cost him his life. Upon hearing this dire prediction, the prince vowed to defy this grim prophecy and set off on his noble quest. Along his journey, he encountered three witches who slowly poisoned the young prince's mind with lies about his wife's infidelity. They mocked his naivety, convincing him that while he chased after a phantom threat, his wife had given birth to a bastard child. Consumed by doubt and rage, the young prince turned from his sworn duty to save the realm and went back to confront his wife, and the newborn babe she was now cradling in her arms, just as the cataclysm began. In the ensuing devastation, a chandelier fell on his wife, causing a great fire and setting her aflame. As the princess burned to death, she begged him to save their child and take him away from the spreading flames, but in a brief moment of indecision and doubt the flames engulfed the child, consuming him alongside his wailing mother. With her dying breath the princess cursed him to live out the lifetimes of all the souls whose deaths could have been averted by him on that cursed day had he not fallen into madness, and upon pronouncing the curse the young prince was set aflame and swept away by strange mists, along with the three witches who had poisoned his mind - now risen as Banshees, cursed to remind him of his folly every night until the curse is broken."

It is unclear whether the cursed prison of Hollowmoor was specifically created to keep her confined or whether there were perhaps other Dark Lords before her, now complete forgotten and faded. Her very presence seems to either announce or directly cause the birth of Lamenting Ghosts, which call her 'Mother' though blood-curdling wailing shrieks. Due to this, many believe the Spirit of Sorrow to be the very first Banshee, and the mother of all heralding spirits. Great sorrow hides behind her mournful and empty eye sockets, seeming to speak of some ancient and terrible tragedy that even now, countless centuries later, still torments the spirit."

#descr "The Butcher of Nightmares was born a simple farm child, to a loving mother and a cruel, abusive father.   As a young boy, he was tasked with the responsibility of tending to the animals, work he thoroughly enjoyed. Years passed and the little boy matured until the day came where his father bid him assume new and greater responsibilities, those of slaughtering the farmyard animals that he so loved. Horrified at the thought of killing his beloved friends, the boy rebelled. That dark day, it is said, the boy died and a monster took his place. As punishment for his rebelliousness, the boy's father made him perform hideous vivisection on the still living and twitching animals, stripping him of all compassion until his eyes were dried of tears and hollow, and filled with something far worse. In the following years the boy went on to became a famous butcher, one taking great pride in his abilities and skill with the cleaver. It took many years after people first started disappearing for the truth to come out. The Butcher's dark appetites were finally discovered when he was accidentally caught red-handed, in the midst of a vast slaughterhouse, full of countless hooked rotting corpses, dismembered animal and human parts, and the overpowering, putrid smell of blood that permeated the building. 

The Butcher of Nightmares is capable of chopping off limbs in a single strike and all those who follow him will bask in his bloodlust. His blood-stained apron and monstrous appearance are horrifying to behold on the battlefield. His legend and tales of his slaughter have grown to such proportion that he has received a substantial cult following from all sorts of twisted and sick individuals who try to follow in his footsteps, hook and cleaver in hand."

#descr "Once a young and unassuming mage with modest dreams, the Flesh Angel's life was marked by ordinariness in every aspect. However, everything changed when she encountered a captivating young lord who stole her heart. Consumed by love, she yearned to win his affections, but her humble existence offered little chance of success. Determined to make herself irresistible, she delved into forbidden arts and dark magic. Lacking experience and skill, her attempt at a complex ritual went awry. The weaving she performed was successful, but with devastating consequences. Her beauty surpassed that of divinity. To look upon her was to feel unreasonable wanton and carnal desire. Soon she was nicknamed the Angel of Beauty and no man was without lust for her. Men succumbed to their basest instincts in her presence, committing unspeakable acts upon her. Yet, the women of the city harbored a wholly different reaction and what they did to her was far more horrifying. While her beauty stirred up lust and desire in all men, it stoked hatred and jealousy in the hearts of the simple women of the city who wanted to punish her for stealing the affection of their men. They captured her and militated her body, ripping the flesh and skin of her back across metal spikes to resemble wings, turning her into a twisted mockery of an angel. But even in that grotesque moment her enchantment remained unyielding, continuing to captivate those who laid eyes upon her. Thus, she became the Flesh Angel - an abomination both horrifying and irresistible, trapped in a paradox of repulsion and desire. The atrocities inflicted upon her left her broken and twisted in both body and spirit and turned her into a true monster.

Now, the Flesh Angel feeds on the lust of men, and vitriol of women. Her horrifying beauty plagues their dreams, and she is able to enter them and devour their souls to feed her blackened and hollow heart."

#descr "In the fertile lands of Kael-Nahra, Amatep rose to the throne as a beacon of hope. The youngest son of a dying dynasty, he was crowned Pharaoh after his father’s untimely death. Unlike his predecessors, whose reigns were marked by decadence and neglect, Amatep was beloved by his people. He was a ruler of vision, determined to lift his kingdom from the shadow of stagnation. Amatep worked tirelessly to rebuild his kingdom’s glory. Irrigation canals were dug, barren fields blossomed, and the people flourished. His name was whispered with reverence. For a time, he was known as 'Amatep the Just' and the title fit.
But greatness breeds envy. Neighboring kingdoms grew jealous, and war ravaged his lands. Despite his victories, the weight of constant conflict began to wear on him. Each triumph brought more enemies to his gates. The fates, he thought, were cruel to demand so much from one man.
One fateful night, Amatep dreamt of a barren desert beneath a dying sun. In the distance, a shadowy figure whispered: ‘Your kingdom will crumble unless you make it eternal. Only a king who transcends death can preserve his land.’
Haunted by the vision, Amatep became obsessed. What use was rebuilding a kingdom if it would fall upon his death? He decreed the construction of the Grand Pyramid, a monument to house his body and secure his everlasting rule.
At first, the people eagerly joined in the effort, driven by their Pharaoh’s grand vision. But years passed, and the pyramid consumed ever more resources. Crops withered, and taxes rose. As famine spread, the people grew restless, but Amatep ignored their suffering. 'A god must make sacrifices,' he declared.
When the pyramid was finally completed, Amatep stood atop it, ready to ascend. But as he gazed upon his kingdom, he saw nothing but desolation - his people’s bones piled beneath the pyramid, dried rivers, and fallowed fields – before the Mists descended and swept through the pyramid, carrying them to Hollwomoor."

#name "Hollowmoor"
#epithet "The Cursed Prison"
#era 3
#descr "Long ago a magical prison unlike any other was conjured to keep the Dark Lords in eternal confinement. Thus Hollowmoor came to be. The cursed domain was devised as an instrument of endless torture and frustration where even the Dark Lords would be oblivious of their own fate in the grand apparatus. Their souls, black and empty such as they were, became forever bound to the lands of Hollowmoor. While immortal within their own dominion, the Dark Lords are utterly unable to escape its narrow confines. But no prison is without flaw. While the barriers that confine the Dark Lords in their own personal hell are as powerful as ever, the borders of the prison have weakened, slowly spreading their cursed tendrils across the world.
Hollowmoor is a land of eternal torment and suffering where the tiniest bit of fortune quickly turns to bad luck. It is a place where even death does not provide escape from a harrowed life. The lamenting cries and the terror filled dreams of the population act as a beacon perceivable by Hollows, invisible monstrous creatures that stalk the countryside devouring the souls of the population, leaving them empty, soulless husks, sentenced to toil onto oblivion.
The very land of Hollowmoor is treacherous and wicked, and seems to have a will of its own, seemingly able to change beneath ones very feet. A villager might discover that a journey that usually takes but an hour, one that he has made dozens of times in the past, suddenly necessitates an arduous trek of a week or more. Such strangeness has a tendency to manifest at the worst possible moment, such as when ravenous Hollows worry a traveler's step.
A veil of misfortune and unrest plague the inhabitants of Hollowmoor, and thick magical mists spread from it. The Mists of Hollowmoor disorient and confuse all those who would enter them without a proper guide, seeping far and wide into the world, and sweeping up unwary travelers, merchants, and even entire villages back into the cursed lands."
#summary "Dominion: Spreads Misfortune. Generates 1/2/3/5/7/9/12/15/18/25 unrest per turn based on dominion power.
Dominion attracts Hollows based on value: 1/2/3/5/7/9/12/15/18/25% to gain one in provinces with temples.
Pretenders incapable of leaving dominion without dying. Receive their own sacreds upon awakening.
Military: Monsters, living, magic, undead troops. Hollows which devour population and control unrest.
Magic: Death, Nature, Glamour, Blood, some Fire, Astral, and Earth. 
Priests: Average."

#name "Cursed Dice"
#descr "As the story goes, these weathered, bone-carved dice were once owned by a notorious gambler and pirate known as ‘Bitter Jack’. According to legend, Bitter Jack won a fortune using these dice, cheating and deceiving his way to wealth and infamy. His arrogance eventually led him to cross the wrong witch in a high-stakes game. In her rage, she secretly cursed the dice, ensuring that they would always bring ruin to whoever held them. Soon after, he lost everything, his ship, his crew, and eventually, his. Now, whenever these cursed dice are cast, they bring misfortune to the player, ensuring bad luck, failure, and disaster in any endeavor - be it gambling, risky ventures, or even survival at sea. The dice roll favorably at first, drawing victims in with false hope, before rapidly turning their fortune to doom. Rumors suggest that the cursed dice are still passed among pirates, left behind on ships or in tavern as a cruel prank or vengeance on unsuspecting enemies."

According to an old drunkard’s tale, both the cursed and the lucky dice are thought to be fragments of the same creation - a single, magical pair of dice crafted by an ancient, forgotten god of fate. This god split the dice into many, imbuing one half of them with blessings of fortune and the other with the weight of misfortune. They were scattered across the world, forever altering the lives of those who find them. It is said that reuniting these lost sets of dice could restore their original form, allowing the bearer to control both luck and fate itself, though at a terrible cost."

The first mate himself was soon cut down by another crew member, and so the bloody betrayal continued until most of the crew lay slain. The few who remained took their shares of the treasure and scattered to distant shores. But the captain, defying death, survived his grievous wounds. Over the years, he hunted down his former crewmates one by one, and through dark magic, he bound their souls to an enchanted map which would lead him to all his stolen plunder. This cursed map now reveals the locations of ancient treasures hidden across the seas, its course guided by the greed of the souls bound within it."

Relatively lightweight - at least when compared to the hulking ship monstrosities - the hand cannon is ideal for close-quarter combat and remains powerful enough to wreak havoc and soften up foes before the chaos of the melee ensues. Still, these hand cannons are a rare sight as their cost is typically far too great for most pirates to afford, making them the preferred tools of wealthy and boastful pirates, who tend to adorn and personalize them with intricate design and use them as expressions of wealth and style as much as a deadly weapon."

#descr "With this ritual the Black Spot is placed upon an unfortunate individual in a distant land, a mark of death that cannot be removed by any known means. Those carrying the mark will inevitably find themselves dragged into the unforgiving sea and drowned by a monstrous black kraken. However, the curse’s power is only as strong as the victims believe it to be, and those who dismiss the curse may find themselves spared its dire effects."
#details "Adds Curse + Battle Fright afflictions on a random commander in the targeted coastal province. Those with the combination of these two afflictions will suffer a 10% chance of getting attacked by a Black Kraken while in coastal provinces.
The mark will not work on mindless, inanimates, animals, nor gods, and will only have effect if cast at coastal provinces."

#name "Batten Down the Hatches"
#descr "Only after the Maelstrom of the Abyss has been conjured through a ritualistic sacrifice can the Sea be beseeched to spew back from impossible depths what she has greedily devoured over the centuries.   
From the churning heart of the newly-created colossal whirlpool, sunken ships long lost to the sea, along with their damned crews, will rise from the bottom of the Abyss, eager to set sail for distant shores and plunder once again. No coasts are spared their devastation, but those that fly the black sails of Tortuga."
#details "Every turn Batten Down th' Hatches is active, all non-Toartugan coastal province will have a 12 percent chance of being attacked by a Damned Pirate King and his undead crew. This global can only be cast after Haul Wind has been performed and the Maelstrom of the Abyss site created."

Once they reach the far side of the sea and are surrounded by naught but the deep blue, a ritualistic sacrifice is undertaken. One hundred souls are made to walk the plank and resigned to the merciless waters. As the first sacrifice breaks the surface of the sea, a small whirlpool begins to swirl beneath them, growing in size with each successive offering. By the time the final soul plunges into the abyss, the whirlpool becomes a colossal maelstrom that threatens to drink in the world, reaching impossibly deep, leagues beneath the ocean’s surface, all the way down to the unfathomable depths of the Abyssal Plane. Though this ritual is well-known to all Pirate Kings, few, if any, are keen or mad enough to perform it as the ensuing maelstrom is difficult to escape and too often takes much more than just those made to walk the plank. Only once the swirling depths have been awakened can the sea be beckoned to release from the depths what it has greedily taken and spew back the sunken galleys of old with their damned crews."
#details "No less than five Pirate Kings are required to be present while this ritual is performed.

Black sails will become a constant sight on the horizon and the threat of raids an ever-present danger. Once the curse has been enacted, it cannot be lifted by any known means until the dark magic fueling it eventually fades."
#details "This ritual will enable a series of negative events to befall the targeted province. It can only be cast from a shore, and though it can target any terrain, it will have no effect unless a coastal province is targeted with it. Once the spell is cast no subsequent placing of domes will prevent the curse from taking effect until it runs its course."

#descr "The Damned Cannoneer is an undead pirate brought to life to pillage and plunder once again under the command of a dreaded Damned Pirate King. The cannons of these risen pirates are filled with eternal torment of the damned and will make even the bravest of men break rank and flee. Undead pirates are miserable creatures devoid of all earthly pleasures, but not the urges to pursue those pleasures. Though they cannot feel the sensation of fine liquor burning down their throats, or exquisite food filling up their bellies, they still linger for the taste of it all, never being able to satiate themselves and quench their desires. Those damned will engorge themselves for even the fleeting chance to stave off the ever-present hunger and thirst. 

Each cannon is cared and operated by a retinue of trained Cannoneers and should one die in battle a new one will replace him after the battle, unless the cannon is wholly destroyed along with its crewman."

Those made to dance the hempen jig will find themselves slowly suffocating and struggling for air. Inanimate beings won't suffocate by being hanged but they will often suffer at least some damage from the tightening rope. Though the hempen rope is a manifested by the Shipwright's mind, it still follows physical laws and is governed by the Shipwrights personal strength, as if he were pressing the rope with his own bare hands."

They are an undisciplined bunch who prefers the open sea and raiding unsuspecting trade ships rather than real battles. This has earned them the nickname Sea Monkeys. Either that or the furry and mischievous companions who somethings accompany these pirates. Buccaneers mainly keep to themselves and are typically found in the Jade Monkey tavern, one of the numerous taverns located in every pirate city."

They are armed with a falchion, the only weapon they need, and are the only pirates to ever use shields of any kind. These shields are not merely for defense; they are an extension of the swashbuckler's flamboyant personality, often elaborately decorated and wielded with a sense of theatrical flair. Their affinity for the thrill of adventure drives them to seek out danger and excitement wherever it may lie, making them some of the more daring and audacious of their kind."

These grizzled pirates which have sailed around the world and returned with vast knowledge, bolster the crew’s morale on long sea voyages, their lively songs helping to pass the time and keep spirits high. During raids, however, the tune of their shanties changes, and is infused with strange magic. These songs, delivered in dry, salty voices and often song in obscure languages learned upon distant shores empower those who hear them. There are many types of sea shanties and many strange languages they are sung in, and no Shantyman know them all. While the captain may be the most crucial member of a ship’s crew, the ship may yet function without one, whereas the same can’t be said if it misses a Shantyman. It is said that a good Shantyman is worth at least ten seasoned hands in battle.

While the Shantymen are spellsingers, they are capable of casting spells at regular speed."

#descr "Pirate Kings are figures of great power and authority in the pirate community of Tortuga. Only the most formidable captains, skilled in both battle and the treacherous game of politics, rise to this prestigious rank. Those who can navigate the cutthroat world of betrayal and scheming manage to hold onto their thrones for years, until they are eventually dethroned by someone more cunning or ambitious. Their ruthless personalities and fearsome combat skills keep them at the pinnacle of the pirate hierarchy. 
Pirate Kings revel in their status and often indulge in luxuries and the company of impressionable young women. They inspire great loyalty from their crews through fear and admiration, and their reputations as fierce warriors and cunning tacticians precede them, striking terror into the hearts of their enemies. Tales of Pirate Kings who have plundered entire towns, escaping with overflowing treasures and the local lord's daughters, have made many a bard and storyteller wealthy.
Though they care little for religious pomp and ceremony, Pirate Kings are not above offering human sacrifices to calm the seas when the winds turn against them. Their ships, the largest and most heavily armed in Tortuga, are floating fortresses equipped with dozens of cannons and other fearsome weaponry, reinforcing their dominance on the open waters."

According to legend, Scylla was once a beautiful nymph, beloved by the God of the Sea. Consumed by jealousy over Scylla’s beauty and the affection she received, the Sea Goddess used her magic to kill her lover and curse Scylla, transforming her into a monstrous creature. Cast into the depths of the ocean, she is condemned to roam the seas, forever haunted by the loss of her former life and lover."

These sleek, snake-like beings are notorious for their elusive nature, often hiding among rocky shorelines or in the crevices of abandoned ships. Though diminutive in size, they possess an unsettling awareness and are believed by pirates to be the hatchlings of legendary deep-sea serpents, destined to grow into colossal, fearsome creatures that dwell in the abyss.
Pirate folklore holds that these creatures carry a fragment of ancient sea magic, enabling them to influence ocean currents or communicate with the monstrous serpents they are said to become. Sightings of Miscreations near a ship are considered an ominous sign, causing many superstitious sailors to abandon their voyages rather than having their ship sunk by deep-sea serpents."

#descr "The Ghost Ship is a thing of myth and legend in Tortuga, and many other ports around the world. It is a favored tavern tale among sailors across the Seven Seas. Despite many accounts and fanciful stories told about it over the long years, few truly believe in its existence - for few are those who ever survive to tell the tale of the Ghost Ship and its damned crew. Yet, every so often, a lone survivor will appear to once again stoke interest and tell outlandish and schilling tales of a hulking, spectral ship that appears without warning, gliding silently above the cold, dark waters, its form shimmering in the dead of night.
Though tales of new sightings are rare and far between, they often share eerie similarities. The Ghost Ship is said to appear only on the darkest of nights, when the moon is hidden behind heavy clouds and the seas are wrapped in thick, impenetrable mist. The ship’s arrival is silent, its approach unnoticed until the ominous wail of its damned crew is heard, sending a chill through even the most hardened sailors. The grave silence of its arrival is rarely broken by alarm bells, but rather the deafening roar of its cannons, firing without mercy. Legends claim the Ghost Ship is armed with as many cannons as a full Tortugan armada - if not more - and that from its decks, waves of cursed pirates spill forth, seemingly without end. Though the tales of the Ghost ship are often dismissed as exaggerated or fantastical, the chilling consistency of each retelling leaves even the most skeptical sailors uneasy."

The Smuggler has a 25% chance of finalizing his business each passing month, and upon completion can sail back to a friendly Tortugan fortified coastal province to deliver a large, but varying amount of gold and even gems."

#descr " Miss Fortune is a ruthless mercenary whose exploits have earned her a fearsome reputation across the Seven Seas, and is perhaps one of the few Tortugan pirates whose reputation in distant lands is greater than even in the ports of Tortuga. Even as a little girl she always dreamed of leaving Tortuga and sailing the Seven Seas and all the exotic places beyond. When she came of age - which is to say when she took her first life on the streets of Tortuga - Miss Fortune decided that she had an affinity for such work and became a bounty hunter. Over the years she used her considerable talents and even more considerable charm to collect many bounties in one song-worthy adventure after the other, which let her fulfill her dream of exploring the breadth of world. Those she hunted soon began to dread the mention of her name, calling her ‘Misfortune’ as those on her bounty list rarely escaped their fate. Her reputation and bold exploits turned her into a living legend, with tales of her deeds traveling far and wide – and eventually making their way back to Tortuga. Now Pirates of Fortune flock to her sails for a chance to hunt and raid with the infamous Miss Fortune and share in her spoils and glory."

After a particularly memorable raid on a wealthy noble’s estate, Jacob retired from piracy, intent on living a life of luxury. With a veritable king’s ransom of wealth, he immersed himself in a world of lavish balls, high fashion, and philandering. However, his indulgent tastes far outpaced even his considerable loot, and it wasn’t long before his treasure dwindled. Despite his fortune, Jacob's lifestyle of excess and scandal only bought him so much time before he found himself on the brink of financial ruin, no longer welcome in the elite circles he had grown accustomed to. Faced with the grim reality of his dwindling wealth, Jacob resolved to pull off ‘one last raid’ to restore his fortune and return to his opulent life. Jacob has come out of retirement several times so far.”

Tess was once a gifted young and ambitious witch who used her limited gift of foresight and her feminine wiles to uproot a Pirate King, and crown herself as the first Pirate Queen of Tortuga. Over the years her popularity and prominence among the pirates grew considerably, bolstered by her expanding witching powers. A skilled pirate in her own right, cunning, and gifted with arcane and mystical powers, Tess is a force to be reckoned with, and is well known across the Seven Seas, as even the most ruthless of the Pirate Kings pay her due respect."

#descr "Fashionably Late Triple Barrel Jack, commonly known as 'The Crazy Cannoneer', is the most famous pirate cannoneer. Since his earliest days, before he could barely hold a cutlass in his hand, Jack was fascinated with cannons, bombs, and all things incendiary. Nothing else but his love for explosions and the heavy iron beasts of war ever held his attention; not even the latest pirate fashions, the allure of bejeweled cutlasses, or fine silken clothes looted from nobles of distant shores. 
Upon reaching manhood, Jack's father - a moderately successful pirate with a humble treasure - presented him with a cannon. Since then, Jack's fascination and interest in cannons continued to grow as he meticulously studied, modified, and perfected them. This fascination eventually turned into an obsession that made many pirates whisper that the Crazy Cannoneer would caress his cannons more lovingly than a man could any a woman, for he spent more and more time with these metal behemoths of death, always improving, adjusting, and maintaining them. Some swore he even slept nestled in the arms of his cold mistresses, the barrels of the cannons. 
In recent years, Jack completely withdrew from the bustling life of pirate society, to the solitude of his cannon workshop. Rumors swirled that he was working on something incredible. Eager to finally unleash his latest invention in the plundering of the world, Jack has emerged from his hermitage and presented his newest design, the triple-barrel cannon, a beast of unprecedented destructive capabilities."

Desperate to calm the chaos around them, the witches gathered their magic and attempted to quell the storm’s fury. But instead of calming it, their spell pulled the raw, untamed chaos from the storm itself. As their magic gathered around the storm, it coalesced and gave form to something far greater than they had intended. From the eye of the tempest, a colossal serpentine figure emerged, its body made entirely of raging water, and the Hydralith, the Chaos of the Deep was born. While the storm was quelled and dissipated, the Hydralith remained. Ever since, the Hydralith has been known to appear in raging bodies of water across the wide world, summoned by nature’s wrath or unwitting magic."

When a cataclysmic storm raged over the seas for seven days and seven nights, terrified sailors and coastal dwellers cowed in fear and prayed for the storm to abate. In the heart of the tempest, as the skies tore open and the seas churned in fury, a massive wave took on the shape of a great bird. From this chaos, the Cerulean Spirit was born, and with its arrival, the storm subsided, leaving calm waters in its wake. Composed entirely out of water, the spirit is said to be both serene and destructive, capable of unleashing powerful waves with the beat of its wings, or calming the roughest seas with a gentle sweep of its feathers. Its form constantly shifts, shimmering with the colors of the sea, from the deep blues of the abyss to the sparkling azure of sunlit waters."

One fateful night, as another rainless thunderstorm loomed on the horizon, a powerful entity emerged from a hidden spring. A figure of pure water, graceful and cloaked in a dress of flowing currents. This was the Aspect of the Sea, born from the desperate yearning of a parched world. As it stepped from the spring, water surged upward, transforming the dry land into the vast seas and lakes that now cover the earth. Wherever the Aspect of the Sea walked, streams, rivers, and seas followed in its wake, ensuring the surface would never again be without water. Now, the Aspect rises wherever its presence is needed, emerging from puddles, wells, and lakes to watch over the seas and waterways."

Both fascinated and frightened by the Nightmare of the Deep Fathom, pirates and sailors across the Seven Seas began to secretly worship him as though he was a god, hoping to either be spared his wrath, or to join in his misdeeds, drawn in by the allure of his terrifying persona. 
It was not long before he plunged the Seven Seas into chaos and the shores were fraught with terror. Furious at this impudence, the Goddess of the Seas banished the Night of the Deep Fathom to the deepest and darkest recesses of the seas for an eternity. Now, the Nightmare of the Deep Fathom has broken free from his watery tomb and emerged from the depths to yet again pillage the world and receive the prayers of men. Terror and misfortune will spread in any land he is located in."

#name "Spirit of Water"  
#descr "The Spirit of Water is said to be the last remnant of an ancient, forgotten pantheon of elemental gods who once shaped the world. Long ago, she was a goddess of flowing rivers and tranquil seas, revered by sailors and farmers alike for the life-giving waters she commanded. In her prime, her domain stretched across every waterway, from the smallest spring to the vastest ocean, and she was worshipped as a benevolent protector of life and fertility. But in an age of upheaval, when the elemental gods waged war for dominance, the Water Idol was betrayed by her fellow deities. Fearing her power over the world's waters, they bound her essence to a small body of water, deep within a desolate, uninhabited island. With her freedom stripped away, the waters she once commanded fell under the sway of lesser spirits, and her name faded from history.
Countless years passed, and the island remained untouched, the pool of water forgotten. That is, until one day a group of sailors fleeing from their pursuers stumbled upon the island’s shores. In their exploration, they discovered the ancient pool, and upon gazing into its depths, they felt the pull of the Water Idol's presence and began to worship the being trapped within. It was around this pool that these outcasts built their settlement, which would eventually grow into the infamous pirate haven of Tortuga. Now, after eons of dormancy, the Water Idol stirs once more. The centuries of worship and countless offerings have begun to rekindle her power. Slowly awakening from her long slumber, she seeks to reclaim the vast domain she once commanded, her wrath as deep as the oceans and her desire for vengeance undiminished by time. As she rises, the waters begin to churn, heralding her return to power, and soon, the seas will be hers again.

Costal Tortugan provinces will have a 1% chance per dominion candle to receive 1d6 Water gems while the Spirit of Water is awake."

#name "Tortuga"
#epithet "Black Sails"
#era 3
#descr "Tortuga, the so-called pirate kingdom, is a divided society. It is not so much of a unified kingdom as it is a barely-functioning and volatile collection of treacherous pirate factions ruled by self-serving, short-lived Pirate Kings. The society is marked by constant infighting, as these pirate kings constantly plot and scheme against each other while also being embroiled in countless other conflicts with powerful lords, or even distant emperors. There is no lasting loyalty among them. Alliances shift as quickly as the tides, and betrayal is a way of life. 
In times of crises - which are quite frequent due to the deleterious way of life brought on by unscrupulous political maneuverings and double dealings - pirates seek the counsel of Sea Witches and the enigmatic Sea Crones, whose ancient wisdom offers fleeting moments of stability.
Conflict is the norm in Tortuga, as piracy thrives on chaos. Pirates relish in raiding and pillaging unsuspecting victims, and as such they rely on surprise attacks and an overabundance of weaponry to carry the day. The use of heavier armor is rare as wearing it may all too easily turn into a death sentence at sea due to danger of going overboard. In this lawless realm, every pirate sails for themselves, and Tortuga remains on constant brink of collapse, held together only by shared greed and the ever-present lure of plunder."
#summary "Race: Humans. Start on a rich island if possible. Damned pirates arrive yearly if island start. 15% income bonus in coastal forts.
Military: Heavily armed but lightly armored troops. Ocean sailing, stealthy units, cannons.
Magic: Air, Water, Astral, Death, Glamour, some Blood and Earth.
Priests: Weak. Can perform blood sacrifice.
Dominion: Tortugan dominion has a 2% chance per dominion candle to spawn a Master of the Seas and 4d3+4d3 Raiders and Hijackers in enemy coastal provinces."
#brief "A sea fearing nation ruled by blood-thirsty and fame-seeking Pirate Kings. Pirates use heavy weaponry but they do not carry armor."
