#description "The Forgotten Realms - Total Conversion Mod 
0.90 (archived)
0.91 (archived)
0.92 (archived)
0.93 (current)

Built with love for the community to be the most complete depiction of the Forgotten Realms fantasy setting available on PC. 

It always felt incomplete without the Underdark. No more. 

!This mod also basically requires the Forgotten Realms Underdark map mod available here on the Steam Workshop. Playing without the map will skip out on hundreds of starting units and their unique magic-site based recruitment!

Designed for the Single Player experience, this mod packs more than 1,000 new units, mechanics, items, spells, events, magic sites, and nations. 

The current nation list includes all the nations from the Dom 5 version of the mod: Waterdeep, Luiren, Zhentarim, Calimshan, Cormyr, Spine of the World, Savage Frontier, Chult, The Shaar, Halruaa, Thay, Unther, Mulhorand, Chessenta, Aglarond, Impiltur, The Silver Marches, Amn, Baldur's Gate, Narfell, The Cult of the Dragon, and Corwell of the Moonshaes. 

It also now brings to life: the drow of Menzoberranzan, Maerimydra and Llurth Drier, the dwarves of Deep Shanatar and The Great Rift, the duergar realms of Gracklstugh and the Underspires, the mindflayers of Oryndoll, the Yuan-ti of Serpentes, the Kuo-toans of Sloopdilmonpolop, Myconids of Auramycos, the undead giants of Cairnheim and the Aboleths of The Glimmersea.   

The Underdark is represented in 3 separate planes and can be traversed through more than 100 gateways. Use the number keys 1 through 4 to ease navigating the interface. 

Nearly 800 provinces in total should keep you busy. Victory Conditions are yours to set. There are 56 potential throne points: 13 L1 Thrones, 14 L2, and 5 L3 Thrones with more to be added. 

Have a blast!"

#selectmonster 429
#name "Black Hand Assassin"
#nametype 266
#descr "As an extension of the will of the dark wizard Manshoon, the Zhentarim was initially formed as a mercenary company to support his rule over the Moonsea with the aim of spreading that control over all of Faerûn. After he recruited the faithful of Bane, unscrupulous merchants and lesser mages to his cause, they collectively sought to dominate all aspects of the Realms, either by manipulation, outright control or, if they couldn't exert control over something or someone, then outright murder.

Black Hand Assassins were deployed when potential 'friends' chose to be uncooperative."

#name "Priestess of Akadi"
#descr "Blaskaltar was a settlement in the Shaar, ruined for long ages by the mid–14th century DR. It was home to the First Shrine of the Queen of Air, the first known shrine dedicated to the goddess Akadi. The structure itself had long been erased by time, the elements, and neglect, leaving only a mound by 1370.

Nevertheless, every Midsummer, the faithful of Akadi from all around Faerûn, after traveling for a ritualized ten days, gathered there for their only calendar festival. Together, they chanted the names of all those who'd died in the last year and gave thanks to the heroes of the faith. 

While most returned to their scattered homes across the realms at the conclusion of the celebration, quite a few chose to remain in the Goldmane Expanse and assist the faithful of the local gods and attempt to win converts to Akadi."

-- x 564 -- Sea Troll 
#selectmonster 564 -- Sea Troll 
#name "Scrag"
#descr "A scrag is a marine troll, a gilled form of the common troll. Often found near the mouths of major rivers, Scrags need considerable room to hunt. Scrags did not use tools or weapons, living simple, barbaric lives. When attacking, they would swing their claws with abandon at anything that moved, biting anything that got close enough. If attacking the seagoing vessels of the land-bound races, they would claw into the hull and climb over each other to get onboard and wipe out the crew.

Like their land-bound cousins, they could only be truly harmed by acid and fire—two substances that are much harder to find underwater. Locathah, however, had found that starcoral, a coral that grows ten times as fast as other corals, was nourished by saltwater scrag flesh, and weapons made from it could be used to disrupt a scrag's regeneration. They would then dismember it and stuff the wounds with small pieces of starcoral.

Saltwater scrags found light, even that of merely a full moon, uncomfortable. They would therefore rarely approach the surface of the sea unless it was at night."

Few among them possess magical talents, but their close connection to water, nature, and death mixed with their propensity to mate with nearly anything has led to magic in the veins of some."

#selectmonster 430 -- Black Harpy
#name "Redfanged Harpy"
#spr1 "ForgottenRealms/harpy1.tga"
#spr2 "ForgottenRealms/harpy2.tga"
#descr "Harpies were notoriously malevolent and sadistic, taking enormous joy in hurting, torturing and killing their victims, and were always seeking more. They were fond of entrancing travelers with their songs and luring them to shockingly cruel dooms. When they were done playing with their captives, they slew them and finally devoured them.

They were not particularly intelligent creatures, and were prone to cowardice in the face of superior power.

The most notorious harpies lived within the Kingdom of Nix, where they were instrumental in Redfang the Reaper's reign of terror over Vanesci Hamlet in the 7th century DR. Swooping down from high in the skies they would kidnap villagers in nets, carrying them away and eventually dropping them into the cauldrons of Nix. The demise of their hapless victims produced a burst of mana that powered the kingdom's bloodforges."

#descr "Among the tallest of true giants, frost giants could tower higher than 21 feet tall. Men often grew beards, which would become matted with frost and icicles.

The frost giants had a reputation among other races for being crude and of low intelligence, but they were very cunning fighters. They greatly respected brute strength and battle prowess. For frost giants an individual's place in the ordning was determined by evidence of physical might, often taking the form of a combination of the individual's ability to wrestle and boast. Though it could also take the form of musculature, scars from battles of renown, or trophies fashioned from the bodies of their enemies. It was not uncommon for them to try proving their strength and improving their status by challenging a white dragon. Because of this violent way of life, most frost giants died in battle rather than passing away peacefully.

Whenever frost giants of different clans met and their status was unclear, they would wrestle for dominance. At times this could resemble a festival, with giants cheering on their clan's champions and making bold boasts or challenges, but at other times it could take the form of a chaotic free-for-all."

#desc "Forest Trolls could reach heights of 11 feet tall. Their thin and wiry frame held deceptive strength and fortitude, and, like all trolls, possessed the remarkable ability to regenerate wounds and even lost limbs. 

Trolls had little in the way of society. They traveled in non-migratory clans of 3-12 and, upon discovery of an area rich with prey, would establish a lair, most often within a cave. They were often located near smaller human settlements, including established roads as those who traveled off the path served as a great source of food. Once established within a region the band of trolls would hunt and devour as extensively as possible until all resources had been exhausted.

Any culture they possessed was passed down orally, usually kept within a single clan. Communication was often simple assertions for dominance or a mating female presenting a kill, along with a shared meal, to a prospective male."

The royal palace came under siege by an angry mob for several weeks, as a tax revolt escalated into food riots and then a full-scale revolt. Many city guardsmen were killed.

From the Dragonmere Bay of Cormyr and Sembia in the west to the Alamber Sea of the Old Empires in the east, it formed a thoroughfare of trade and cultral exchange that laid the foundation for the rampant diversity of the Forgotten Realms. Through an interconnecting series of deepwater bays, navigable rivers, heavily-patrolled canals, dangerous portages, and deadly underground rivers, it allowed naval traffic from Zhentarim's Moonsea in the north all the way through to the southern Lake of Steam to form an unbroken route to the Shining Sea and onward. 

The sea was the crucial trade way for the many people's of Faerûn. The coastal nations that held the shores did so at great peril. Pirates, Sahuagin, Locathah, Krakens, and the sleepless dead were only a small handful of the many dangers the lurked in the mist. The captains who plied these waters prayed day and night to the gods of the sea to keep them safe on their journeys."

During the Time of Troubles, Mystra was killed by Helm when she defied the will of Ao the overgod and attempted to leave the Prime Material Plane before securing the stolen Tablets of Fate. At the conclusion of these events, also known as the Godswar, Ao offered the position of Goddess of Magic to the wizard Midnight, who reluctantly accepted and took Mystra's name in order to smooth the transition after so much chaos.

Mystra kept watch over magical research and regulated the advancement and dissemination of magical knowledge throughout the mortal world. As the centuries passed, Mystra grew tired of the ceaseless grasping for power through pleading, flattery, or treachery. She and her portfolio were the target of gods and mortals alike and that took its toll on the Mother of All Magic. She enlisted the help of many 'Chosen' over the centuries, and allowed them to aid in the governance of her vast portfolio as they willed, for good or ill. Among her Chosen are Elminster, Khelben Blackstaff, The Simbul, and many others."

#descr "Bane was the Faerunian god of tyrannical oppression, terror, and hate, known across Faerûn as the face of pure evil through malevolent despotism. From his dread plane of Banehold, The Black Hand acted indirectly through worshipers and other agents to achieve his ultimate plan to achieve total domination of all Faerun.

Bane was a wholly malevolent and brutal deity that distanced himself from mere mortals, preferring to reign over his followers from afar. He savored the terror he instilled in others and the hatred that formed in mortals' hearts, utilizing this strife to gain greater control over the Realms. While Bane believed himself the rightful ruler of all the planes and could not tolerate subservience to anyone, the god was willing, unlike many evil deities, to work with others if it served his interests and the god formed multiple alliances. Most notable perhaps was his alliance with Myrkul, which stretched back to when both were mortals and which continued until both of their deaths during the Time of Troubles. Bane also had working relations with the gods Loviatar, Talona, and Mask; when Bane returned to life in 1372 DR, he quickly went about reforging these alliances, primarily by reasserting their fears of him. But as numerable as his allies, Bane had many enemies as well. For a time, Bane's most hated foe was the goddess of magic, Mystra, whose power he coveted."

Bhaal was served by the goddesses Talona and Loviatar, and he in turn served Bane.

Before his ascension to godhood, Bhaal was a power-hungry adventurer on Toril. Along with his companions Bane and Myrkul, he sought to attain the portfolio of the God of the Dead, Jergal. After defeating one of the Seven Lost Gods, the three were able to travel to Jergal's domain, the Castle of Bone in the Gray Waste. Upon their arrival, Jergal willingly offered his realm to the Dark Three, though they couldn't decide amongst themselves who would rule. Upon Jergal's suggestion, the three divided his power, deciding how to divide it based on the outcome of a game. The three played a game of knucklebones, and Bane emerged as the victor. He claimed the domains of hatred, strife and tyranny as his own. Myrkul, coming second, chose rule over the dead, the ultimate fate for all of Bane's minions. Finally, Bhaal chose the divine province death itself - and chose to manifest this through violence and murder."

#descr "Myrkul was a god of the dead and later a god of decay and exhaustion in the Faerûnian pantheon. He was originally a mortal man, a necromancer named Myrkul Bey al-Kursi, who ascended to godhood alongside Bhaal, the god of murder, and Bane, god of tyranny. His portfolio and home, the Bone Castle, were both usurped by the mortal Cyric and later passed on to the ascended Kelemvor. However, as that which is dead can never truly die, Myrkul was worshiped as a god once more in the 15th century DR, the Reaper who brought more souls for the new Lord of the Dead to judge. The face of the Lord of Bones, the white skull shrouded in a black cowl, was recognized across the Realms as the symbol of fear and death, the paragon of nightmares.

From his mortal life and well into godhood, Myrkul maintained a complicated kinship, if not outright friendship, with Bane and Bhaal. He counted Shar as an ally and Chauntea, Lathander and Mielikki among his foes, though the latter was likely a much longer list.

The worship of Myrkul was never popular in Faerûn, his influence inspired through the fear of death. He wasn't widely worshiped so much as dreaded, and even blamed for the natural difficulties that accompanied growing old.

His worshipers, who were often undertakers in one form or another, were a morose, secretive lot, reticent to share their faith with those outside his meager and unorganized church. These Myrkulytes were tasked with ensuring the people of Toril both feared and respected death. To aggrandize Myrkul's power they would propagate rumors that merely touching one of his priests would bring certain death."

#name "Lathander, the Morninglord"

#descr "Lathander, whose title was The Morninglord, was a deity of creativity, dawn, renewal, birth, athletics, spring, self-perfection, vitality, and youth. He favored those who dispelled the undead and blessed those who planted new life. Lathander was also the god called upon to bless birth and fertility related ceremonies.

All of Lathander's clergy respected art, liberty, nature, and culture; promoted betterment of oneself; and strove to bring hope to their followers and others. Many of these followers worked in various creative arts. They were intolerant of evil, especially undead and inaction that caused evil to prosper. Most ceremonies of Lathander were held at dawn and actions and contracts agreed to at sunrise were said to be blessed by him. Funerals, among his followers, were held at dusk, and followed by a wake that lasted until dawn.

Some followers of Lathander insisted that he was in fact the reincarnation of Amaunator, the Netherese god of the sun. Others took this heresy further, claiming that he would take up the mantle of the lawful neutral Amaunator again, and that the transformation from deity of the morning to sun god was imminent."

#descr "Chauntea was the Faerunian goddess of life and bounty, agriculture and cultivation. She viewed herself as the embodiment of all things agrarian. She was believed to be one of the eldest gods in Faerûn, born when Toril was created by the primeval battles between Shar and Selûne. Selûne favored her and nurtured her with her light and with the help of Mystra, Chauntea grew into one the Realms' most powerful gods.

Also known as The Earthmother in the Moonshae Islands, as Bhalla in Rashemen, as Grandmother among the Uthgardt, and a zillion other names on a zillion other worlds, she was ubiquitous anywhere civilization flourished. Seen as the tamer, she walked in parallel to Silvanus who held dominion over the wilderness. 

The Earthmother had strong ties with other deities concerned with nature, such as Shiallia and Mielikki and was known to have romantic affiliations with Lathander. Her most despised enemy was Talona, the Lady of Pestilence, whose disposition to wreak suffering, disease and decay upon the natural world led her to oppose her with upmost vehemence. She was always in conflict with Talos. Chauntea battled deities who sought to desecrate and expunge nature; she opposed evil deities such as Malar and Bane, and viewed the latter's resurgence as portentous."

#name "Tyr, The Even-Handed"

#descr "Tyr was the lawful good greater god of law and justice in the Faerûnian pantheon and leader of the coalition of deities known as the Triad, which also included Torm and Ilmater. The titles of The God of Justice allegorized his nature to his followers. He bore his title of the Maimed God for his missing right hand, lost in an act of bravery and self-sacrifice and his title of the Even-Handed referred to his position as the god of justice, though was also seen as dark humor. The wounded eyes of the Blind Overlord meanwhile were seen as symbolic of 'blind justice' and the cost that sometimes came with living a lawful life. His symbol however, balanced scales upon a warhammer, truly symbolized his nature; justice upheld with armed vigilance and benevolent might.

Among Tyr's worshipers were judges, lawyers, magistrates, the oppressed, paladins, and police. His worship was particularly popular in the lands of Calimshan, Cormyr, the Dalelands, the Moonsea, Sembia, Tethyr, and the Vilhon Reach. This highly organized church of Tyr was strong in the more civilized lands of the Realms. Followers of Tyr were expected to show fairness, wisdom, and kindness to the innocent and never enforced an unjust law.

The Statue of Tyr increases order, production, and growth and possesses a wide range of magical paths to build on."

He was the god of those who suffered, the oppressed, and the persecuted, who offered them relief and support, encouraged them to endure, and who encouraged others to help them, to take their burdens or take their places. He was called the Crying God, the Broken God, the Lord on the Rack, and the One Who Endures.

Across Faerûn, the hardy people of the harsh and war-torn land of Damara particularly venerated Ilmater, as well as his champion, St. Sollars. In Calimshan, Ilmater was one of the most frequently worshiped gods, especially among the lower classes and slaves.

Attending clerics during a battle were recognized by the coarse furred shirts they wore. It was considered a great wrong to harm these priests as they helped ease suffering. Even orcs and goblins held them in esteem for ministering to their fallen people and not just humans.

Both fertility and magic bless the lands that worship at the altar of Ilmater."

Known for his constant scheming, cool head, and oft-reserved biting comment, Mask lost a significant portion of his power, the intrigue portfolio, to Cyric. This, of course, led to two things: an enduring hatred of Cyric, and the Lord of Shadows leading himself to be more direct than he was in his prior, elaborate plots.

He was a manipulator and valued subtle schemes, so artful and light that no one noticed the god's touch. Mask enjoyed eavesdropping, and he could whisper in perfect imitation of a voice he had recently heard. He used this mimicry to purr falsehoods into mortals' ears or talk with voices of recently dead to create an illusion of them still being in the land of the living.

The church of Mask stated that wealth rightfully belonged to those who could acquire it. Honesty was for fools but apparent honesty was a very valuable thing, and subtlety was everything."

#descr "Mielikki was the neutral good goddess of forests and forest creatures, particularly dryads, and the patron of druids and rangers in the Faerûnian pantheon. The Lady of the Forest was also known as the goddess of autumn. Mielikki had long dwelled upon the Prime Material plane itself, though the precise location was unknown to all but her most trusted and secretive followers. 

Mielikki's worshipers were concentrated in the northern parts of Faerûn, namely in the Delimbiyr Crescent and Loudwater, High Forest, the North, the Silver Marches, and in the city of Silverymoon; in the Dalelands, particularly Archendale, Daggerdale, Harrowdale, and Shadowdale; and in Cormanthor, as in Elventree. In the east, they could be found in Rashemen, Aglarond, and the Great Dale, and in the south as far as the Chondalwood. She was among the major non-elven deities venerated in Myth Drannor in Cormanthyr before its fall.

During the Time of Troubles, when the gods walked Faerun as mortals, Mielikki suffered little, for she had already walked the material plane for milennia. Despite this, her followers were whittled down in number as they sought to aid in the recovery of the Tablets of Fate. By the end of the events of this episode, Mielikki was left with so few worshippers that she was in great danger of losing her station as a true goddess."

He was the creator and preserver of the Tel'Quessir, governing those things held in the highest esteem among elves, such as magic, music, arts, crafts, poetry, and warfare. He approved of those who killed orcs and followers of Lolth, blessed those who aided others, and became angered at those who defiled the dead, or fled from their foes. Elves believed that they were reincarnated with a definitive, final goal of perfection. Corellon, alongside Sehanine Moonbow, was the souls' guide towards that perfected state. 

Corellon wandered incognito on Toril to observe priests and craftsmen, and was even known to take a direct hand in protecting elven borders. As a general rule, he watched over the elven race as a guardian. It has, however, been nearly 1,000 years since Corellon engaged in world-shaping events on Faerun. Some time before 714 DR, before the fall of Cormanthor, elves wearied of competing with humans over land and wanted land for themselves free of encroaching human expansion. Under Corellon, the Seldarine started the Retreat, a mystical compulsion felt by elves to abandon their lands for Evermeet. Most of Corellon's orders followed the call and left Faerûn. The Time of Troubles, however, changed much of that attitude, and Corellon has been spurred back into the fray as the Seldarine pantheon struggles to maintain their relevance and thus their immortality."

Many temples to Gond were not just ordinary places of worship, but within, machines such as internal combustion engines were displayed and vehicles such as gondrollers were sold. Notable temples to Gond included: High Holy Crafthouse of Inspiration, a monastery in Illul on the isle of Lantan run by the High Artificer Danactar, Most Holy Servant of Gond and The House of Inspired Hands, one of the largest temples in Waterdeep led by High Seeker Jhoadil Zulthind. 

It was there, in Lantan, that during the Time of Troubles, Gond's avatar took the form of a gnome who washed up on the shores of the island in the Trackless Sea. His divinity was quickly recognized by the Lantanna people and Gond was revered for the duration his avatar remained in the Realms. 

Gond was, however, not picky with whom he supported with his inventions. Cyric commissioned from Gond a great number of suits of powerful armor for his forces, who used them to decimate his enemies in the heartlands in the decades that followed the Time of Troubles."

#name "Shar, the Shadow Weaver"

#descr "Shar was the Faerûnian goddess of darkness and night, the malevolent twin counterpart to the goddess of the moon, Selûne. She was also the creator of the Shadow Weave, a dark counterpart and attack upon the Weave of Mystryl and her successors. The domain of The Mistress of the Night was not only that of dark places, including caverns, dungeons, and the Underdark, but of deeds done under darkness, of secrets, loss, hidden pain, and the ability to forget.

The very existence of Shar was paradoxical; the Nightbringer was brought into existence by the creation of Realmspace, but was the living embodiment of the void, the perfect nothing that existed before she was born. The emptiness that she originally reflected had itself been erased at the start of time, and she longed to return to the ancient calm of nonexistence. By her very nature, Shar was defined by loss, the foolishness of hope, and the basic principle that life was a joke.

Her rivalries with Mystra and Selune are legendary. Shar eventually made allies of Bane and a patsy of Cyric in 1374 DR, following the Time of Troubles. Together, their followers attempted to conquer Myth Drannor while the Church of Shar attempted to wrest control of magic away from Mystra through various means. She eventually succeeded in her plots and was successful in creating a supernal realm known as the Shadowfell from which she rules."

#descr "Uthgar, the Battle Father, was the god of physical strength, the patron deity of the Uthgardt barbarian tribes. As a god, Uthgar was known for his competitive nature in combat and tireless ethic for training and tactics. He truly enjoyed everyday pleasures such as coupling, eating, drinking, hunting, or the camaraderie of another warrior. He gained his divinity in the Year of the Icy Axe, 123 DR, when Uthgar engaged in battle with Gurt, the Lord of the Pale Giants. While Uthgar slew the giant leader, he sustained mortal wounds and succumbed to death on the site that would be known as Morgur's Mound. His followers declared themselves the 'Uthgardt' in his honor. After his body was interred within the burial mound, he was sponsored by Tempus and granted divinity. Uthgar would eventually come to serve as exarch to Tempus, and considered his patron to be his one true ally.

He disliked a number of powers for stealing away the faithful from a number of his tribes. Helm and the members of the Triad stole away the worship of nearly all of the Black Lion tribe and Malar all-but ruined the Blue Bear tribe. 

Common among all the tribes beliefs was strength above all else. Warfare and hunting demonstrated strength, whereas arcane magic exemplified weakness. The family of the tribe, along with their ancestors were to be held sacred. The Uthgardt totem beasts brought wisdom to all through the fear and respect commanded by the tribesmen."

The Lord of Knowledge was the leader of the Deities of Knowledge and Invention, which included Deneir and Gond as well. Oghma was the most powerful god of knowledge in Faerûn. 

The Binder of What is Known, or simply the Binder, he was also a member of the Celtic pantheon as a neutral or neutral good intermediate deity of speech and writing, as well as patron of the arts and everything beautiful and creative in all genders. Oghma's domain was nothing less than the whole of knowledge and thought, whether they were written down, spoken aloud, or even still remained in the mind, for the idea was the purest and highest incarnation of knowledge.

It was Oghma's burden to choose which ideas and thoughts would spread and which would fade away with their creator, so that all others would not be in jeopardy. Resting heavily in his heart were the experiences of millennia and hence in this duty he was serious, firmly protective, and deeply cautious. He favored a doctrine of ideological conservatism and sticking strictly to the status quo, rather than risking a rogue idea disrupting the delicate balance of knowledge he had been preserving since history began."

#descr "Cyric was the monomaniacal Faerunian god of lies, trickery, and strife, having previously held dominion over tyranny, murder, lies, intrigue, and illusion. It was the unholy radiance of the Dark Sun that drew power-hungry mortals to their inexorable deaths like moths to a flame. 

For a time Cyric was among the most powerful deities among the Faerûnian pantheon, having taken on at least partial portfolios of five different deities. He drew much of his own power from the constant in-fighting between the various sects and cells of his church. 

When he appeared as a manifestation, Cyric preferred to take on the appearance of a wraith that haunted the dreams of mortals or that of a poisonous cloud of smoke. When he couldn't be bothered to appear himself, Cyric merely created nightmares of undead in the psyche of his victims.

The Cyricist church was hated across Toril with good reason: Cyric's church was pledged to spread strife and work murder everywhere in order to make folk believe in and fear the Dark Sun. It supported cruel rulers and indulged fostered fear and intrigue while avoiding the spread of outright war. The church was often beset by internal feuds and backstabbing for some time before eventually waning. Many outside the church viewed it as a twisted den of madness, trickery, and death. Cyricist clergy condemned this outlook, preferring to see their religion as one of enlightenment. It purportedly revealed that all societal bonds of friendship, family, and love were nothing but ties that always withered away, and were therefore useless, weak, and pitiful."

Talos is the destructive god of nature. He is the hurricane, the storm, the earthquake. He is fierce, unrelenting, and capricious. He is aloof and uncaring. Talossan worshippers attempt to mark each major holiday with the summoning of lightning and storms.

Talos was the leader of the Gods of Fury, a collection of deities including Auril, Umberlee, Malar, and himself, that he brought together through sheer force and which he kept together under his tight control.

The church of Talos was small by the standards of a greater deity, and his followers were fanatical in their love of destruction. The clergy had no formal hierarchy; obedience was enforced through might. Priests of Talos were fond of extorting sailors and farmers, threatening that Talos would bring destructive storms upon them if they did not placate the angry god. They were wont to pursue wealth and luxury with many indulging in acts of random or spiteful violence, pillage, and banditry. Talossan clerics were also committed evangelists who sought to gain converts through fear or the enticement of raw power."

Afterward, in −2809 DR, Oyai led the peoples of the Tabaxi, Eshowe, Thinguth, and several others who'd accepted the faith of Ubtao to follow Ecatzin and the couatls across the ocean to Chult. There, she ruled as the first Negus Negusti (queen of queens).

Afterwards, Ubtao personally selected the rest of seven barae from among the citizens of Mezro sometime after he created that holy city in −2637 DR. He originally appointed them to assist him in dealing with the petty issues of ruling the city of Mezro, but when he continued to grow weary of the people's fickle demands, he left Chult altogether and passed the rule and defense of the city to the barae."

#name "Helm, the Watcher"

#descr "Helm was the Faerûnian god of guardians and protectors, worshiped by guards and paladins both. The Vigilant One had long been seen as a cold and focused deity who impartially took the role of defender, and sometimes enforcer, but his activities in the Time of Troubles caused the folk of Faerûn to view him differently. The Watcher was the epitome of the vigilant guardian and embodiment of the spirit of watchfulness, whether used for good or ill.

During the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR, when the gods were forced by Ao to walk Toril as mortals for having stolen Tablets of Fate, it was reliable Helm whom Lord Ao trusted with the task of keeping the other deities from returning to their divine realms in the planes. For this task, Ao left Helm with all his divine abilities, guarding the Celestial Stairway to the supernal realms.

On Midsummer, when the goddess Mystra — who had spirited away a portion of her divine power in the realms, which she then recovered once the gods were cast from the heavens — attempted to pass Helm without the Tablets. She was warned to turn back by the Watcher, but when Mystra forcibly tried to pass, he destroyed her. The other deities and their followers regarded this act as heinous, despite Helm's dutybound cause. Many followers left his worship and many of those who remained would lose their way and begin campaigns of oppression and tyranny, particularly across the sea in Maztica.

In 1384 DR, while conveying messages from Tyr to Tymora during the pair's courtship, a strange and fateful misunderstanding resulted in the accusation that Helm had stolen Tymora's heart. Helm was subsequently slain in a duel by Tyr and Cyric was suspected to have had a hand in these events. The finality of Helm's demise remains uncertain."

In the 14th and 15th centuries DR, Tymora held the portfolios of the good fortune, skill, victory, adventurers, justice. Commonly known as Lady Luck, Tymora shone upon those who took risks and blessed those who dealt harshly with the followers of Beshaba.

Tymora was a cheerful and curious goddess, who inherited Tyche's grace and kindness, when the latter was split apart. She did not have any malice or vengeance in her, since both of these emotions were inherited by Beshaba. Tymora was well-known for her antics over the centuries. She was much more adventurous and less serious than any of her fellow deities.

Tymora was the most famous deity around the country of Cormyr, after she protected their capital, Suzail, during the Time of Troubles. Her efforts prompted a resurgence of her faith throughout the nation. 

Commonly consisting of adventurers and others who relied on a mixture of luck and skill to achieve their goals, the Tymoran clergy encouraged folk to pursue their dreams. Members of Tymoran faith believed that one should be bold and trust in one's own luck. Priests of Tymora were taught to think of themselves as their own masters and to be brave enough to accept both good and bad fortune, as a trust in their goddess and in themselves. They were also duty-bound to aid the daring by providing healing and even some minor magic items."

#descr "Orcus, also known as Tenebrous, was a demon prince and purported primordial that served as master of the undead from the depths of the Abyss. Returned from undeath but not technically alive, the Demon Lord of Undeath was the multiverse's staunchest advocate for stagnation, seeking to exterminate all life, to darken and desolate all worlds, until all that remained in his static reality were undead moved only by his will. The Blood Lord was believed to be one of the mightiest demon lords, one that inspired dread in the hearts of gods. 

The Shadow That Was was among the powers of the Abyss most often worshiped as deity by the mortals of the Prime Material plane, and even more than the Prince of Demons himself, was close to obtaining true divinity. 

Orcus could not be harmed by non-magical weapons, highly resistant to the elements, nearly impervious to magic, and wholly immune to any magical or mundane charm or fear. He could appear as an aspect of himself to any of his deathpriests that perform the appropriate ritual. He was believed to be capable of destroying the phylactery of any lich at will, and would readily do so if they displeased him. Similarly, if the physical form and phylactery of any lich was destroyed, Orcus could return them to existence as a vestige.

While many mortals worshiped Orcus as a god, he was not capable of granting them powers as a true deity. His followers did receive clerical powers albeit from some unknown source. Some believed these powers originated from the Negative Energy plane itself."

The supposedly ancient Sea Mother viewed the kuo-toa as her children, though she herself might have been the nonsensical spawn of her fanatical followers' madness-fueled imaginings.

Blibdoolpoolp was a bloodthirsty goddess filled with hatred for the pain her kuo-toa children suffered at the hands of many races. A special enmity was held for surface-dwelling races, as well as illithids and drow. Humans and particularly elves were spited for the initial driving of her children to the Underdark, while mind flayers and drow were seen as competitors for the little territory her followers had left. On the other hand, her hatred for sea dwellers was relatively minor, except for sea elves.

The Sea Mother was irrational, prone to unpredictable mood swings and fickle changes in behavior. She was also highly secretive, shunning contact with most other deities. She believed herself to hold deeply fundamental magical secrets related to the nature of the universe, but hoarded those secrets to herself, making them impossible to check.

The Sea Mother placed a high value on pearls, which were considerably more effective than normal gems and precious metals in gaining her favor."

Despite being an easy target, the Abomination of Moander had thick natural defenses, absorbing most attacks into its rotting mass.

Those who were unlucky enough to be swallowed by the Abomination were crushed as endless tendrils rotted away their equipment, clothes, eventually killing them and adding the carcasses to Moander's avatar. Some who survived within the creature could be infected with the seed of Moander. The deity gained knowledge of all those "blessed" with the seed. That connection worked both ways, granting the victims a brief look into the god's mind. 

During cold months, the Abomination of Moander retreated to warm lands or into lava filled hot cavers of the Underdark, where it was fed and guarded by the dread god's clergy. Moander's core could move between piles of filth of big enough size through exuding a relatively small flying egg-shaped pod. These pods contained the essence of Moander and allowed it to possess another rotting body, creating a new Abomination. Given enough putrified matter, the Jawed God's avatar could vomit a shambling mound or other foul and rotting creation."

#name "Amodeus, Master of the 9 Hells"

#descr "Asmodeus was the Faerûnian deity of indulgence and a patron of oppression and power. The greatest devil and ruler of all devilkind, the Lord of the Ninth was overlord of the Nine Hells as a whole.

Asmodeus was a primal embodiment of lawful evil and a supreme strategist of unparalleled skill. His sinister machinations could take centuries, if not millennia, to come to fruition, and his master plans extended across the entire multiverse. His labyrinthine, insidious intrigues could seem inexplicable to most outside observers, for Asmodeus let even his own servants stew in fear of his next move. With all the planes as his board, the Lord of Lies maneuvered the forces of evil like chess pieces in his grand designs, slowly and subtly manipulating everyone from deities to, when needed, lowly mortals.

Just as Asmodeus was an unmatched schemer, he was an unrivaled orator, a legendary political master of unquestionable prowess. He was the most well-mannered of the archdevils, soft-spoken and eloquent as he lured others into serving his ends. Even when wracked by constant pain, he managed to appear blithely unbothered, and seemed almost chillingly reasonable. However, though he could seem generous, the quickly offered rewards of the archdevil were given to those willing to sign away their souls, after which they would suffer as a pawn in his dark designs. Despite his charisma, Asmodeus was nonetheless a representative of ultimate evil, revealing his true nature at his will.

Each turn, he will summon various devils to his cause so long as he is within his dominion."

#name "Silvanus, Old Father Oak"

#descr "Silvanus was Faerunian power of wild nature, standing in contrast to the more ordered, agrarian nature represented by the goddess Chauntea.

Silvanus had both clerics and druids in his faith, though their presence varied by location, with druids being the more prominent due to his narrow focus on wild nature without concern for balance. One could even find halfling druids revering him over their own pantheon's nature deity, though this was a rare occurrence. Some barbarians, hermits, wilderness dwellers, and rangers also worshiped him.

His clergy often worked together with the clergy of his allies, Mielikki and Eldath, towards common goals. With the latter two being instructed to support, protect, and (if the need arose) obey the clergy of Silvanus. These included protecting the wilderness from further encroachment by civilization, such as the felling of trees and limiting farms or ranches to already cleared land. Also the fighting of diseases, planting new plants, and fighting those who did the bidding of Malar.

His worship was widespread across the east and south of Tethyr, especially in the Forest of Tethir, in the Dalelands, the Moonshae Isles, the Chondalwood of the Vilhon Reach, and the Yuirwood in Aglarond."

The All-Seeing Savras lost his place as the god of spellcasters to Azuth and later swore an oath of fealty to him, becoming the specific deity of his school of magic - Divination. While some believed Savras guided the forces of destiny, others thought he knew all history but was unable to affect it - his emotionless demeanor simply a mask he wore to hide his deep concern for Faerun's fate. 

Savras was worshiped in both the north and south as a god of diviners and truth-speakers. His clergy was still sparse in the late 14th century DR, as Savras had just been released from his centuries-old prison following his famous duel with Azuth. He was particularly beloved in the nations of the Chultan Peninsula, where scrying and spying were practically the national pastimes because the inhabitants' fear of the yuan-ti."

#descr "Azuth was the Faerûnian lesser deity of arcane magic whose concerns included the perpetuation of the magical arts as a craft. The Lord of Spells was a servant of Mystra and worshiped by all manner of arcane spellcasters, earning particular veneration from wizards.

Records of Azuth's life as a mortal were virtually non-existent and Azuth himself did not deign to answer questions regarding the topic; therefore, most of what was known of Azuth's life was legend.

As a mortal man, Azuth was hungry for power, and in his search for it he studied several lost empires in the hope of finding forgotten magical secrets. Eventually his dedication lead to him being granted the title of Magister, the first of his kind, recognized by Mystra as her most promising mortal pupil.

During or shortly after the Dawn Cataclysm, in his bid for divinity, Azuth sought to steal a portion of the demigod Savras' power in a gambit that ultimately failed. This led to a protracted series of battles between Azuth and Savras, culminating in a duel that shattered a mountain and created a deep lake. Azuth was successful and managed to imprison the deity Savras within a staff he had created, the Scepter of Savras. And thus, with the help of Mystra who had now become his lover, Azuth finally ascended to divine status."

#name "Elminster, The Sage of Shadowdale"
#descr "Elminster Aumar, most often referred to as the 'Sage of Shadowdale' or the 'Old Mage,' was one of the most famous and powerful wizards in all of Faerûn. He was also considered one of the Realms' most preeminent sages. His name was known from the Sword Coast to the far-off jungles of Chult and the eastern Realm of Thay. Over the course of his centuries-long life Elminster had saved the people of Faerûn from destruction or subjugation on numerous occasions and earned himself a legendary reputation among its people.

Before he devoted his life to the Mystran faith or began his wizardly studies, the young Elminster possessed the innate ability to heal himself and detect magical auras at will. El was exceptionally intelligent—a gift that was bolstered by multiple castings of the wish spell. He was also blessed with an eidetic memory, that allowed him to recall information from years past in quite an impressive manner.

Elminster was rumored to have learned much of his understanding of arcane magic from Arkhon the Old, a mage who died in Waterdeep some five centuries before the Era of Upheaval. By that time in history, El had gained knowledge of every spell that was commonly available to most adventuring spellcasters in the Realms. He did not use every spell he knew, however, preferring to avoid those from the conjuration school of magic, or any associated with creatures from the lower planes."

In the 14th century DR, Tymora held the portfolios of good fortune, skill, victory, and adventurers. Commonly known as Lady Luck, Tymora shone upon those who took risks and blessed those who dealt harshly with the followers of Beshaba.

Commonly consisting of adventurers and others who relied on a mixture of luck and skill to achieve their goals, the Tymoran clergy encouraged folk to pursue their dreams. Members of Tymoran faith believed that one should be bold and trust in one's own luck. Priests of Tymora were taught to think of themselves as their own masters and to be brave enough to accept both good and bad fortune, as a trust in their goddess and in themselves. They were also duty-bound to aid the daring by providing healing and even some minor magic items.

Tymoran clergy would often go throughout the lands of Faerûn and urge people to take chances and pursue their dreams, yet wouldn't encourage them to indulge in reckless whims and frivolity, while they discouraged wasting time making plans without ever doing anything. They aided those who had dared to reinforce the message of the good fortune that one can get by having enough trust in Tyche."

#descr "Upon securing a suitable host, mind flayers began the procedure by rendering the candidate docile with a mind blast. A mature tadpole, selected after surviving a period of one decade in the elder brain's brine pool, was then inserted in the host's cranium through a nostril, ear canal, or eye socket. It then burrowed into the brain and quickly devoured the gray matter, growing in the process as it replaced the brain with its own tissue and attached itself to the brain stem like a parasite. This initial process, which happened over a period of a few hours, effectively completely replaced the victim's personality with the tadpole's, while still keeping the body alive for the second stage of the transformation.

It was only possible to interrupt ceremorphosis and save the host before this initial stage was completed, and even so it was only possible to do so by killing the tadpole, which was complicated by its location. The safest way was to incinerate or crush the host's head and then use spells such as resurrection, or true resurrection. Destroyed parts of the victim's personality could then be reconstructed via restoration and heal spells, as long as the damage was not complete.

Mod Notes: 
An Elder Brain must be present in the province to recruit a Ceramorph. Upon recruitment, it will transform into 1 of 4 types: a Lesser Illithid, a Mindflayer, or a Ulitharid."

Duergar adventurers were most commonly concerned with personal gratification, and were frequently fighters or rogues, leaning on their training against the threats of the Underdark. Because of their cruel nature, experienced duergar adventurers often became assassins or blackguards.

Duergar were in some ways even better adapted to underground living than other dwarves. While other dwarves lacked the capacity to see completely in the deepest darkness, this was not a problem for duergar. Duergar were also immune to many of the ancient techniques used by the mind flayers to control them, such as paralysis, phantasms, alchemical poisons, or some types of illusion."

In the decades that followed her parent's and her people's victory against Kazgaroth and the close of the Darkstalker Wars, nearby Myrloch Vale, where her mother sat court as High Druid, suddenly shifted resonances. An eruption of mischevious Fey began to emerge from Moonwells across the islands. This was followed by the arrival of Fomorian giants on the Island of Oman, pushing out the Northlanders from their capital. Then, a year later, the ancient Eladrin city of Karador rose from the waters of Myrloch Vale. These ancient elves claimed that they had long ago ruled the island for 11,000 years and decalred the rebirth of their realm under the Fey Queen Ordala. Her god-like powers far surpassed that of the druids, and the Earthmother sat silent in response to these claims. 

Alicia joined her parents and all human inhabitants of the island, fleeing in terror. Not long after, her parents would re-enter Myrloch Vale and attempt to contact the Earthmother via the Feywild. Knowing this journey would likely lead to his disappearance, High King Tristan abdicated his throne to Alicia. "

Robyn's druidic talents led her deep into Myrloch Vale, where she communed with the Earthmother and made a powerful friend and ally in the goddess Chauntea. She would soon after be named the Great Druid of the Earthmother for her fight against Kazgaroth and the servants of Bhaal and Malar. 

It was during these conflicts that it was revealed to Robyn that she was a ward, not the daughter of King Byron. This sparked an emotionally confusing time between her and the young Prince Tristan, whom she had grown up believing was her brother. Their mutual feelings of admiration and trust led to romantic attraction and the two fell madly in love. They soon married and had two daughters, even while the war raged around them. 

In the decades that followed their victory against Kazgaroth and an avatar of Bhaal at the conclusion of the Darkstalker Wars, Myrloch Vale suddenly shifted resonances and an eruption of mischevious Fey began to emerge from Moonwells across the islands. This was followed by the arrival of Fomorian giants on the Island of Oman, pushing out the Northlanders from their capital. Then, a year later, the ancient Eladrin city of Karador rose from the waters of Myrloch Vale and decalred the rebirth of their realm under the Fey Queen Ordala. Peasants and nobles alike fled the island of Corwell, including the capital city, and became refugees within the palisades of Caer Callidyrr."

#descr "Tristan Kendrick was a member of the Kendrick family and the prince of Corwell. He despised the duties of his station as a child and, even after the outbreak of the Darkstalker Wars when he was reaching for the age of 20, his actions were often irresponsible, even if effective. When the Northlanders and their firbolg allies invaded en mass, Tristan shirked his duty as leader of the garrison and instead ventured outside of the castle to rescue a friend who had once saved Tristan's own life. In the course of this adventure, Tristan discovered the legendary Sword of Cymrych Hugh - a blade long ago fashioned by his ancestors to combat the immortal Kazgaroth. An epic battle eventually decided the war and saw Kazgaroth and the servants of Malar and Bhaal defeated. Tristan was killed in his heroic triumph, along with most of his companions, but they would be resurrected by the Earthmother. 

Still a prince, Tristan was the target of an assassination attempt by a Thayan wizard in the years shortly after the Darkstalker Wars. The attempt inadvertantly killed Tristan's father, the King of Corwell. It was Tristan and his beloved wife, The High Druid Robyn, who kept the islands from descending into civil war. 

Many other plots threatened the Kingdom throughout Tristan's reign, but he saw the kingdom through and unified the Moonshae Islands until the auspicous re-emergence of the ancient Eladrin city of Karador in Myrloch Vale. The chaos that followed led Tristan to abdicate his throne to his daughter, Alicia, and join Queen Robyn in an attempt to contact the Earthmother for aid. The two disappeared into Myrloch Vale, never to be seen again."

#descr "Born in 1347, Deirdre was the second daughter of King Tristan and Queen Robyn Kendrick, born barely a year after her sister Alicia. As they grew up, Deirdre was often openly hostile towards her sister as she channeled her doubts and feelings of inadequacy into rage. She was taught magic by a young court wizard named Keane, but Keane stopped her tutelage when he became frightened of her uncontrollable nature.

In the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR, aged 18, Deirdre was seduced by a priest of Talos named Sinioth. Seeing his opportunity to drive a stake through the heart of this troublesome period of newfound peace, the Storm God possessed Sinioth and began blessing the princess with his unholy power. Giggidy Giggidy. Troublingly, Deidre became a complete pawn of Talos and the Storm God used her to start a war. In the end, though the gods' subterfuge was uncovered, Deidre remained under Talos' sway.  Her sister Alicia, long her rival, was the one to strike the final blow.

While powerful, be wary - at some point, Dierdre will leave your service and become the villain she was born to be. "

#descr "Keane was the Royal Court Wizard for King Tristan Kendrick on the isles of Moonshae. He was known to be a quiet, observant, and studious individual, and his hard work and dedication led him to become a powerful wizard. He was always ready, unlike many of his peers in the libraries, to personally fight evil.

Keane would eventually become the royal tutor of the two young princesses, Alicia and Deirdre Kendrick. He posed as a failed wizard by order of the King. Alicia turned out to have little talent for magic, though her connection with the Earthmother was quite strong, like her mother. Deirdre, however, proved to be a dedicated and talented pupil - though, something dark lurked in her soul. Keane cut off her lessons, though the Second Daughter of Corwell would go on to take up a secret relationship of master-apprentice with an avatar of the Storm-God, Talos. 

As the young Alicia grew into a young woman, Keane would go on to follow her in all her adventures. He helped Alicia battle many foes, revealing his true powers as they destroyed a dracolich, fought off an elder eternal evil known as Ityak-Ortheel, and traveled together to Evermeet. Their feelings for one-another grew, and after King Tristan abdicated his throne to Alicia, the two married, completing Keane's journey from peasant to King."

#descr "High Lady Ordalf was the ruler of the fey kingdom of Sarifal on the isle of Gwynneth in the Moonshae Isles, a rule that lasted over 11,000 years. She was a member of the leShay race - immortal, albino, elf-like fey creature of extraordinary magical power, and technically, 'Eladrin.' This term referred to a family of fey races, including elves, and the leShay were thought to be the Eladrin creator race, and thus the progenitors of all elves. As such, they held enormous magical talents. 

Long ago, Lady Ordalf received a prophecy from a satyr seer that she could only die in the mortal realm but that she must die to save both worlds from a horrifying disease created by the beast lord, Malar. After hearing the prophecy, she moved the city of Karador into the Feywild in the hopes of prolonging her existence in the chaotic time-streams of the faerie realms. 

Following the Time of Troubles, in the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR, she suddenly moved the ancient capital city of Karador back to Faerûn and reestablished her realm in the crystal waters of Myrloch Vale.

The simplistic and crude humans who now called her lands home, the Ffolk, ruled by House Kendrick were no match. The Earthmother went silent - a shock to her druids in the region - and within weeks, Lady Ordalf's decree to banish all humans from the Island of Gwynedd was complete. She has not chased them further, but she and her subjects will defend their dominion at all costs."

#descr "Firbolgs were a reclusive race of giant-kin who preferred to avoid contact with other sentient races. They were both the most intelligent and the most powerful of the giant-kin. If provoked, firbolgs were formidable opponents, skilled both in physical combat and druidic magics. 

Firbolgs had a family-centered, clan-based society. They lived in settlements in remote hilly or forested areas. Their settlements were strongholds, including wooden structures, built from the trees around them with defensive towers with catwalks between. They used their magic to ensure that their homes remained a secret to outsiders and these clan settlements were always small with between about four and sixteen members.

The firbolgs had rejected the ordning, the customary social order amongst giants and giant-kin, and preferred to exercise free will by using a system called 'the code' and a written copy was required to be carried by all firbolgs. It promoted the idea that the society was the most important aspect and superseded the individual. The implications of this code meant that they did not exhibit the same superior attitude that other giants and giant-kin displayed. For every decision made, they considered the effects on the forest and the rest of the natural world. During a famine, they would rather go hungry themselves than strain the land. 

However, while typically noble in their pursuits, their fanatic code and their scattered nature combined to make them relatively easy targets for deception, and malevolent forces often whipped them up into a battle frenzy against their enemies for what the firbolgs were led to believe were unforgivable transgressions against nature."

#name "Kazgaroth's Jarl"

#descr "Political power among the Northlanders lay in the hands of the Jarls. From time to time, one would ascend to power and be given the honorific title of King. 

Under the Jarls, the Northlanders engaged in a centuries-long conflict with the Ffolk from the central and southern isles of the Moonshaes. These 'Ffolk' were more peaceful, and Northlanders sometimes took to raiding their settlements, creating tension between the two peoples as a whole. This boiled over in the Darkwalker War of 1345 DR. 

The Northlanders were believed to be related to the Uthgardt barbarians and traced their lineage back to the people's of Luskan."

Such dedication is inspiring, but has been known to lead to rather short lifespans. 

Unlike the spendthrift Noble Lords, Noble Ladies's economic boosts are to the treasury. Like their male counterparts, they too are tax collectors and defense organizers."

He despised the duties of his station as a child and, even after the outbreak of the Darkstalker Wars when he was reaching for the age of 20, his actions were often irresponsible, even if effective. When the Northlanders and their firbolg allies invaded en mass, Tristan shirked his duty as leader of the garrison and instead ventured outside of the castle to rescue a friend who had once saved Tristan's own life. In the course of this adventure, Tristan discovered the legendary Sword of Cymrych Hugh - a blade long ago fashioned by his ancestors to combat the immortal Kazgaroth. An epic battle eventually decided the war and saw Kazgaroth and the servants of Malar and Bhaal defeated. Tristan was killed in his heroic triumph, along with most of his companions, but they would be resurrected by the Earthmother. 

Of course, since Kazgaroth killed him, it now possesses his face..."

The White-beards ensured the youth were well versed in hardship and suffering with regular lashing and brow-beating. This was their right of passage to adulthood, and it also ensured the Reavers gave them a healthy respect and helped curb their rowdy behavor when things went too far.

As such, the women of the islands tested their mettle early and often and won respect at the end of their sharpened blades. Some resented their biological need to reproduce and instead took on a life of celibacy to keep open the door to glory in battle. These women came to be known as Storm Maidens and were often found at the head of great fleets and were harbingers of momentous shifts in power in the Northlands.

Astrid was a famous Storm Maiden and grand-daughter of Jarl Rault the Wise who was long the most powerful Jarl in the Northland Archipelago. An ally of House Kendrick, Atrid's grandfather was under constant and intensifying pressure to declare independence. At 85 years of age, many believed the old man would never die and they needed to take matters into their own hands. Astrid found herself caught in the middle, and would soon have to decide her own fate and declare her own independence, or otherwise suffer the knife of her own friends and countrymen."

Some time during or around the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR, Branwen realized the troupe engaged in banditry. She rebelled against them but was turned to stone by the mage Tranzig and left at the Nashkel carnival.

She was freed from her petrification and joined the adventurers who rescued her on a journey that would see Sarevok Anchev defeated and the Throne of Bhaal conflict come to an end in Baldur's Gate. 

Branwen has returned home a champion and sees the brewing wars in the Moonshae's as an opportunity to serve her god once more. With the arrival on her temple steps of Jarl Rault the Wise and his grand daughter, Astrid - practically begging for help, Branwen has little option but to offer her oath."

With the decline in power of House Kendrick, and the restlessness of his own Northlanders, Rault faced a difficult choice to maintain his allegiance or to declare the Northlanders' independence from the High King. At 85 years of age and with his health failing fast, with no male heirs and no-one else to turn to, he paid a visit to the famous champion, Branwen, in the village of Seawolf. His hope was to forge and alliance between Branwen and the clerics of Tempus with his grand-daughter, Astrid, and work his last remaining years to establish a future for the Northlanders that would see his people prosper and his grand-daughter take power.

While away, however, Rogarsheim was assaulted by hill giants and duergar from the Jotenhammer Range. In Rault's absence, several of his would-be Northlander usurpers took the attack as an opportunity to sieze power for themselves. They have unseated all the remaining loyalists with incredulous speed, leading to the suspicion that the upstart, foreign priests of Talos are somehow to blame."

Storm giants generally lived inside of castles, either located atop mountains, in the clouds, or underneath the ocean in castles made of coral. Those that could not sustain themselves on hunting alone often built large gardens, fields, or vineyards near their homes.

Storm giants that dwelled on land were usually seen as being on good terms with nearby copper dragons and good-aligned cloud giants, often working with them to ensure a mutual defense.

They were often known to keep pets and guard animals. Those that lived in high elevations, meaning clouds or mountains, typically kept animals such as rocs and griffons. Those that lived underwater would often keep sea lions."

Barghests on the Material Plane operated either alone or with a sibling, lurking in remote humanoid communities or joining bands of goblinoids although they weren't opposed to leading other wicked races. Normally they attempted to keep their true nature hidden for as long as possible, devouring the occasional goblin when given the opportunity until old enough to find more promising prey and too obvious remain inconspicuous. Goblins sycophantically worshiped barghests, each pathetically trying to demonstrate its worth to its host in order to avoid the ire and hunger of their new masters. 

Barghests typically retained their goblinoid forms when leading such tribes, existing in a strange and cruel symbiosis with their goblin host. So long as the goblins could please the barghest with gifts and sacrifices the barghests would protect the tribe from threats and bolster their hoards, with bugbear barghests in particular leading murderous raids on villages."

In truth, they truly appreciated the 'gifts' of those they feasted upon, and sincerely felt that they were giving their livestock a gift of their own when they consumed their brains. 

In spite of their lack of physical abilities, mind flayers were feared by all beings in the Underdark because of their great mental prowess. In addition to the small array of mind-affecting spells that every illithid had at its disposal to take control of its prey, they also frequently employed a powerful mind blast to affect a multitude of foes. The mind flayer's mind blast was a 60 foot cone that stunned anyone caught within it."

In the Year of the Black Horde, 1235 DR, Open Lord Ahghairon officially declared the Gryphon Cavalry part of the City Guard during a huge orc siege on the city. The riders not only fought the orc hordes again, but were also used to shuttle in much needed supplies to the city."

In the Year of the Banner (1368 DR), Lord Thesp's son and heir, Oth Eltorchul, was left a babbling husk after dabbling in the creation of dream spheres with the Mhaorkiira Hadryad. Fallout from the dream spheres affair nearly bankrupted the family, forcing them to open the doors of Eltorchul Academy to all manner of students willing and able to pay. As a result, current students and recent graduates of Eltorchul Academy vary widely in talent, ability, social status, and outlook. 

The school pays for the expensive material components related to crafting magical arms and armor and encourages students to sell the resulting items to pay for the increasing tuition costs. This has led many students unable to afford the tuition to engage in risky arcane crafting practices."

The church did not officially sponsor any knighthoods or military orders, but they often worked closely with the Harpers. Some of Oghma's monastic orders included the Order of the Gilt Laurel, the Children of the Passive Voice, the Fellows of the Forest, and the Companions of the Silver Springs.

Much of the Church of Oghma's power was center within Sembia. Candlekeep, being the center of lore in Faerûn, was also a sacred place for Oghma. Other temples and libraries devoted to Oghma and his church included the House of Knowlege in Neverwinter, the Tower of Thought in Selgaunt, Leaves of Learning in Highmoon, Library of Curna in the Shining Lands, and the Font of Knowledge in Waterdeep."

#descr "Technically, the Watchful Order is one of the city's forty-three guilds, formed to protect less powerful wizards and sorcerers from those distrustful of the Art, but in practice, it acts as the largest arcane academy in the City of Splendors. The Watchful Order encourages prudence in the use of the Art so that arcane spellcasters will be respected and looked up to, not feared and actively opposed. Effectively, it polices less powerful arcane spellcasters who reside in or visit the city, actively discouraging them from throwing spells around to influence the populace. Since many powerful arcane spellcasters are not members of the Watchful Order, the guild uses its influence to mitigate their most egregious behavior as well.

The Watchful Order provides many benefits to members, including forums for arranging instruction and trading in magical information, the sale of rare material components from the golem-guarded cellars of the Tower of the Order, and a market for the buying and selling of spellcasting services, scrolls, and minor magic items. In addition, members of the guild can find regular employ as fire guards and spell guards. The Watchful Order contracts with building owners across the city to respond to fires with summoned water elementals, keeping half a dozen or so fire guards on duty every day. The guild also contracts with paranoid individuals of means to provide spell guards skilled in detecting and countering hostile workings of the Art. The guild's livery is a dark purple cloak, with a white human hand, fingers together and uppermost, on the left shoulder."

Over time, as those apprentices have taken on students of their own, the students of the Lord and Lady Mage of Waterdeep have effectively formed an informal, elite arcanists' academy. Although Khelben and Laeral remain titular master and mistress of the school, most day-to-day administration and instruction of junior arcanists is left to the more senior apprentices.

About fifty apprentices reside at Blackstaff Tower at any one time. The more senior apprentices, well trained in defensive magics, defend the Tower against monstrous incursions and hostile wizards.

Khelben and Laeral make very sure that no one is treated badly or allowed to chafe in restlessness, so the temptation of treachery is slight. Arcanists desiring to leave are always assisted in setting up in new locations so they part with the folk of the Tower as friend. The result is a steady stream of arrivals and departures."

While first and foremost married to Arilyn Moonblade, Danilo counted many other great Faerûnians among the ranks of those to whom he was close.

Danilo began studying under the tutelage of his uncle Khelben 'Blackstaff' Arunsun when he was twelve years old and his previous tutor had given up on him. It was presumably through Khelben that Danilo first began working secretly for the Harpers.

When faced by the public, Danilo acted like a complete fool. He appeared spoiled, shallow, and selfish. He spoke with a lazy drawl. He was widely known for his miscast spells and for generally causing mayhem. However, in truth, his foolishness was all an act that originally enabled him to more easily serve the Harpers in secret. In reality, he was a skilled spellcaster and a crafty adversary who at one point was considered Khelben's 'probable successor.'"

#fixedname "Halaster Blackcloak"
#descr "Halaster is the mad mage of Undermountain and the founder of the proto city that would one day become Waterdeep. In the Year of Scattered Stars, 168 DR, a mage calling himself Halaster Blackcloak arrived at the foot of Mount Waterdeep together with his apprentices, collectively called 'The Seven'. In the center of the Deepwater Plateau, northwest of the flourishing seaside farms, Halaster began construction of Halaster's Hold with a tower and fortified ramparts, with smaller towers for his apprentices. He summoned fell beings from other planes to do the work. But Halaster refused to release the creatures after they constructed his Hold, instead sending them into the caverns to build more and more subterranean chambers. Later sages believed his association with such creatures had corrupted him, causing him to grow in power but also in madness. 

Soon, he claimed the Underhalls of the Clan Melairkyn and started to explore. This began Halaster's Hunts, a long series of journeys into the Underhalls, driving out the drow, duergar, and various monsters that lived there. Meanwhile, the Seven desired to establish their own subterranean holdings and departed Halaster's Hold in the Year of Sundered Sails, 307 DR. They left it abandoned and the people of the surface settlement, then known as Blackcloak Hold, shunned it in a belief it was cursed. By 309 DR, Halaster had complete control over the near-endless tunnels and caverns, having extermined their denizens, and began constructing the largest and most deadly dungeon imaginable, Undermountain. 

In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR, Elminster was inadvertently sent to the Nine Hells while defending the Dalelands from the Shadovar. Mystra made a bargain with Halaster that she would try to cure his insanity if he rescued Elminster from Hell. Halaster agreed, and entered Avernus. Though he was unsuccessful, and had to be rescued in turn by Alassra Silverhand, Mystra kept her word, and managed to partially cure him. She then proceeded to blast Asmodeus with Halaster's insanity."

Durnan was born in the remote North in 1283 DR. He started adventuring with Mirt when the two were ten. Durnan was known as 'The Wanderer' because that was precisely what he spent his youth doing: wandering around seemingly aimlessly, killing monsters.

In 1302 DR, Durnan and Mirt the Merciless went into Undermountain and managed to come back not only alive but also rich. This was one of the first instances of somebody surviving a foray into Halaster's property. He used the looted wealth to tear down the remnants of Halaster's Hold to build the Yawning Portal inn. He spread the information about the size and the wealth that could be found in Undermountain. Combined with the good location, on which he built his inn, it guaranteed him his living by selling equipment to people who wanted to enter the dungeon too. Durnan retired as an adventurer. The reason for this was that he made a promise to his girlfriend at that time to come back to her when he managed to become rich.

His hatred of injustice and unfairness earned him a place with the Masked Lords. This position of authority did not prevent him from taking matters of law into his own hand, and he led a group of vigilantes called the Red Sashes."

He had a heart of gold, despite the relative frequency with which he entered unruly tavern brawls.

Mirt was a Harper as well as a Masked Lord of Waterdeep. Many of the commoners suspected Mirt to be a Masked Lord, and Mirt on more than one occasion engaged in secretly spreading rumors stating that he was not.

He was one of the few trusted friends of Evermeet and had a portal that could give him access to the elven island when he so wished. He carried a purple dragon ring, which allowed him to speak in King Azoun IV's name."

Cybriana was a typical half-elf baby, marred only by a strange birthmark that, as she grew older, developed into a horrid growth bearing an evil face, which seemingly contained a dark spirit within. The growth eventually caused a sickness that threatened to kill her. To save the little girl's life, the elves performed a shamanic rite to extract the growth and trap the dark spirit within a crystal sphere. Cybriana was cured, but the spirit escaped. The dark spirit flew over the countryside, absorbing life energy and taking the form of a drow elf woman named Kilili. 

When Kilili allied with a powerful extraplanar being named Imgig Zu, Cybriana realized that the only way to stop her was to reincorporate Kilili into her own being and accept her dual nature. The resulting being, both Cybriana and Kilili, gave herself the name Kyriani, defeated Imgig Zu, and would go on to many more adventures as a member of the Moonstars under the leadership of Khelben Arunsun of Waterdeep."

#name "Great Beholder"
#fixedname "The Xanathar"
#descr "Several dread beholders have taken up the name Xanathar over the centuries. The most famous among them resided in the bowels of Waterdeep's Undermountain and operated a notorius thieves guild. Some whispered rumors claimed the Xanathar was even a member of the Masked Lords who ruled over the affairs of the City of Splendors, but such claims are almost certainly false.

If you're unlucky enough to get the Xanathar, you'll notice that he cannot be moved or teleported - this is not a bug. He will cause unrest and his guild will bring murder and turmoil to the streets, but if this city is ever attacked, you can be sure he'll defend it - the enemy he knows is preferable to the conquering unknown."

Despite being revered as the hunger and hunting instinct of beasts among druid circles however, he despised The Balance of nature that druids and other nature deities sought to uphold."

He ruthlessly quelled revolts in the ranks of the Black Network, slaughtered his rivals, and weeded the ranks of the young and ambitious by sending such upstart mages on impossible missions to slay Elminster or seize the spellfire wielder Shandril Shessair. Hated and mistrusted by his ally Fzoul, Manshoon calmly manipulated the priest as he did all others - remaining arrogant, untouchable in his power, and faintly amused by everything.

That all came forcibly to an end in 1370 DR, when Fzoul and Lord Orgauth managed to slay Manshoon - and found themselves facing not the sole clone they expected but a dozen or more stasis clones Manshoon created. No one knows who activated all the clones or why, but the chaos caused Faerûn to come alive with ruthless evil archmages, each convinced that he was, in fact, the ''real'' Manshoon and inexplicably compelled to slay his rival clones."

#descr "For years, Fzoul Chembryl served as the second-in-command of the Zhentarim. His shrewd superior, Manshoon enjoyed the support of powerful beholders, while Fzoul contended with the dictates of his deity and rivals inside his own faith. But within the past two years, Fzoul forced Manshoon from power and seized control of the eastern Zhentarim and Zhentil Keep itself. Cunning, self-centered, scheming, and quick-tongued, Fzoul responded to visions sent by Iyachtu Xvim by pursuing a whirlwind path to becoming the Bane-son's Chosen Tyrant. He allied himself with the zealot Teldorn Darkhope in Mintar, and together the two forged a new relic for the faith, the Scepter of the Tyrant's Eye. With the reincarnation of Bane, Fzoul came full circle in his worship of the Black Hand and has been greatly rewarded for his service. Thanks to the power of his deity and his political maneuvering, Fzoul became the Tyrant of the Moonsea.

Fzoul is capable of anything. Quick-witted and a lover of power, he is dedicated to spreading tyranny across Faerûn. He rules Zhentil Keep and holds the titles of High Priest of the Temple of Bane and High Lord of the Zhentarim. In the immediate future, he plans to gain control of Arrabar and Reth to dominate the slave trade from the Lake of Steam. Chondath and Sespech will be next, and Fzoul would like to see Banite temples everywhere."

#descr "Hell hounds resembled monstrous dogs with powerful physiques, standing between 2‒4.5 ft high at the shoulder and weighing about 120 lb. Nessian breeds were the size of draft horses.Their fearsome forms were covered in short, rust-red or red-brown fur and their eyes glowed red. The markings on their bodies as well and their fangs and tongues were the color of soot, and they reeked of sulfurous smoke. Nessian breeds always coal-black fur and were typically equipped with infernal chainmail shirts.

Hell hounds, being intelligent beasts of law, could be trained and commanded by various entities across the planes, but their inherent malice limited their versatility. Outside of retrieving specific objects, hell hounds could only be trained to kill, abandoning or betraying masters that forbade them from sating their merciless hunger. Even if not specifically trained, they stole items from their deceased victims to use as playthings, such as noisy bags or pouches containing a victim's treasures, toying with them until the flammable components eventually turned to ash and the remains littered their dens."

#descr "Among the tallest of true giants, frost giants could tower higher than 21 feet tall. Men often grew beards, which would become matted with frost and icicles.

The frost giants had a reputation among other races for being crude and of low intelligence, but they were very cunning fighters. They greatly respected brute strength and battle prowess. For frost giants an individual's place in the ordning was determined by evidence of physical might, often taking the form of a combination of the individual's ability to wrestle and boast. Though it could also take the form of musculature, scars from battles of renown, or trophies fashioned from the bodies of their enemies. It was not uncommon for them to try proving their strength and improving their status by challenging a white dragon. Because of this violent way of life, most frost giants died in battle rather than passing away peacefully.

Whenever frost giants of different clans met and their status was unclear, they would wrestle for dominance. At times this could resemble a festival, with giants cheering on their clan's champions and making bold boasts or challenges, but at other times it could take the form of a chaotic free-for-all."

#name "Syl-Pasha"
#fixedname "Ralan el Pesarkhal"
#descr "Shortly after gaining the ear of Syl-Pasha Rashid el Djenispool, el Pesarkhal was made the caleph's spymaster during the events of the Darkstalker Wars. His position in the caleph's court was second to none, which granted him access to many of the caleph's slaves and servants. He successfully manipulated the most favored of the caleph's harem slaves, who fell in love with el Pesarkhal. In 1359 DR, a jhasina (harem slave) Malira adh Rashid murdered Syl-Pasha Rashid el Djenispool after el Pesarkhal promised to free and marry her. El Pesarkhal denied all claims that he had coerced the harem slave into murder and had her immediately beheaded after a brief trial.

After Syl-Pasha Rashid el Djenispool's death, his chosen heir Punjor el Djenispool was called from Almraiven to take the throne. A welcoming party was assembled on the new caleph's flagship, the Merry Marid, though Ralan el Pesarkhal had other plans. He had the food and drink aboard the ship poisoned, killing Syl-Pasha Punjor el Djenispool and everyone else aboard, ending the Djenispool family line. El Pesarkhal immediately used his contacts and personal talents in twisting the truth to turn all evidence away from himself and towards a pair of men who had wronged him in the past. His gifts for manipulation and gaining the good will of the masses were readily evident, as he soon had all of Calimport believing him to be a good man wishing to see Calimshan made powerful once again.

Without any political enemies willing to risk setting themselves against el Pesarkhal, he became Syl-Pasha and ushered in a new age for Calimshan. He set himself towards strengthening his control over Calimshan, gaining allies in Tethyr, and rebuilding Calimport into a more organized and defensible city."

Temples to the Lord of Battle looked more like military fortresses than the archetypal temple. They featured barracks, mess halls, armories, and training grounds.

Due to its tendency to have followers and priests on both sides of any engagement, the church of Tempus had no central authority that might support one side or the other exclusively. Within a given temple or order, however, there was a strict hierarchy and chain of command."

Talos, also known long ago as Kozah, was the Faerûnian greater deity of storms and destruction. The Storm Lord's dogma was self-serving, demanding utter obedience from his priests and instructing them to spread destruction where they might. His followers were known as Talassans.

The church of Talos was small by the standards of a greater deity, and his followers were fanatical in their love of destruction. The clergy had no formal hierarchy; obedience was enforced through might. Priests of Talos were fond of extorting sailors and farmers, threatening that Talos would bring destructive storms upon them if they did not placate the angry god. They were wont to pursue wealth and luxury with many indulging in acts of random or spiteful violence, pillage, and banditry. Talossan clerics were also committed evangelists who sought to gain converts through fear or the enticement of raw power."

Ornate temples to the glory of the Golden Lady were usually found in centers of commerce from Tashalar in the south, up through Amn, all around the Sea of Fallen Stars (Chessenta, Cormyr, Sembia, the Vast, Impiltur) and over to Thesk on the Golden Way."

The Mistress of the Night's domain was not only that of dark places, including caverns, dungeons, and the Underdark, but of deeds done under darkness, of secrets, loss, hidden pain, and the ability to forget.

The clergy of Shar were a secretive organization that pursued subversive tactics rather than direct confrontation with its rivals. In many cities where worshiping Shar is barred, these churches and temples are hidden due to their illegal nature. In addition to her clerics, Shar maintained an elite order of sorcerer monks who could tap Shar's Shadow Weave.

Use her stealth and patience and be darkly rewarded."

He was called the Crying God, the Broken God, the Lord on the Rack, and the One Who Endures.

Across Faerûn, the hardy people of the harsh and war-torn land of Damara particularly venerated Ilmater, as well as his champion, St. Sollars. In Calimshan, Ilmater was one of the most frequently worshiped gods, especially among the lower classes and slaves.

Attending clerics during a battle were recognized by the coarse furred shirts they wore. It was considered a great wrong to harm these priests as they helped ease suffering. Even orcs and goblins held them in esteem for ministering to their fallen people and not just humans."

As humans aged far more quickly than elves, Artemis first started to feel the bite of age in 1364 DR, while Drizzt was still as agile and powerful as he was when the two of them first met. On the way to Damara, Artemis inadvertently stole the life-force of a shade with his vampiric dagger. He then appeared to have reversed age a full decade, and his aging slowed considerably.

Leaders among the race often came to power through betrayal or aggression rather than by more peaceful means, or as clerics of the goblin gods. Because of the violent nature of goblin culture, it was not uncommon for goblins to come under the domination of individuals from a larger, more physically powerful culture, most typically larger goblinoids such as hobgoblins or bugbears.

Being bullied by bigger, stronger creatures had taught goblins to exploit what few advantages they had, namely sheer numbers and malicious ingenuity. They favored ambushes, overwhelming odds, dirty tricks, and any other edges they could devise, the concept of a fair fight being meaningless in their society."

#descr "The Church of Vhaeraun was composed of those who worshipped the drow god of thievery. They mostly consisted of drow and half-drow who wanted to see their people freed from Lolth’s oppression.  Many males wishing for better opportunities than the absolute subservience reserved to them among the followers of Lolth, were drawn to Vhaeraun. 

Collectively, the clergy was known as 'the Masked.' Novices were called The Uncloaked, and those past that stage were called Nightshadows. Unlike the drow churches of Llolth or Eilistraee, the church of Vhaeraun was loosely organized in largely autonomous cells. Mainly due to persecution from the priestesses of Lolth, who ruled over the majority of the drow race, there was little expectation of adherence to any dogma or scripture - only the goal of undermining Llolth from the shadows.

As such, Uncloaked Assassins were unwittingly recruited by all drow realms and they served their masters quietly, while also undermining them."

Its long tail had a cluster of deadly spikes, which the creature could launch at its foes as weapons. It had incredibly tough claws and fangs. The mouth of a manticore was full of rows and rows of razor-sharp teeth, similar to that of a great white shark. It used these teeth to feed upon any creature the manticore could catch, be it animal or human. Though they happy settled for the flesh of most any creature, they preferred the flesh of humans most of all.

In the Year of the Groaning Cart, 1267 DR, manticores, along with harpies and perytons, destroyed the city of Lis in the Moonsea region in what was known as the Flying Plague. In Northwest Faerûn, they could be found within the Delimbiyr Vale.

In West Faerûn, they could be found within the land of High Moor.

They will eat population so be sure to put them quietly in enemy lands."

#newmonster 6736
#copystats 2308
#copyspr 2308
#name "Drow Streeakhmaster"
#descr "Drow, also known as dark elves, were a sub-race of elves that predominantly lived in the Underdark. They were hated and feared due to their cruelty, though some non-evil and an even smaller number of good drow existed.

Male military leaders were rare among the Drow. Those who rose to such recognition often were sent on suicide missions known as Streeakhs.

The moral code of the average drow was informed by the teachings of Lolth. From birth, the drow were taught that they were superior to other races, and as such they believed themselves to be the ultimate beings. This mindset created an arrogance so strong that drow could be incapable of viewing other creatures as their equals, including members of their own kind; almost every drow believed themselves to be the epitome of their superior species. The treatment reserved for non-drow ran the entire gamut from pets, to slaves, to grudgingly respected partners if they proved themselves a military match for them, though never equals. As one might expect, this atmosphere of utter condescension meant that most drow generally felt entitled to do whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted to do it."

#name "Orc Warlord"
#descr "Orcs were a race of humanoids that had been a threat to the civilized cultures of Toril, particularly Faerûn, for as long as any could remember. This changed somewhat in the years preceding and immediately after the Spellplague, when a horde of mountain orcs under the command of King Obould Many-Arrows unified into a single kingdom, one that was remarkably civilized.

While some orcs took the title of King, they rarely held sway over more than an extended clan. Traditional orcish culture was extremely warlike and when not at war the race was usually planning for it. Most orcs were part of a confederation of tribes, loosely held together by a despotic chieftain. Bands within these alliances might have wandered far from their homelands, but continued to greet those orcs who belonging to the same tribal network as kin.

Orcish Warlords are excellent raiders and have the resources to organize about 80 troops to set sail. They also collect taxes, but cause major unrest."

#name "Fire Giant Commander"
#descr "The fire giant race began with an individual by the name of Masud, one of the mortal children of Annam All-Father and Othea, who in the kingdom of Ostoria was ceded control of the southern volcanoes. They managed to tame such chaotic environs, building cities of adamantine and mithral. Within this mighty kingdom they acted as its craftsmen, engineers, and military officers. Their craftsmen created some of the kingdom's greatest works of craftsmanship.

Many fire giants, at least in the Ice Spires region, were known to enslave fomorians and verbeegs, as well as occasionally dwarves and gnomes. Slaves held the lowest role in their societal structures and were often treated with little dignity. They typically worked as laborers in their forges and strongholds.

Fire Giants were often hostage takers and took payments from less powerful creatures in their surrounding area in exchange for not attacking them. They were known to occasionally forge alliances with, and even serve, red dragons. They were also known to domesticate hell hounds, keeping them as pets or guards."

#name "Cormyrian Royal Scout"
#descr "The Royal Scouts of Cormyr are an elite order of Purple Dragon scouts in service to the Crown. They serve with their fellow Purple Dragons in patrols across the Forest Kingdom and as the Crown's elite messengers. However, the Royal Scouts are more famous for their work roaming alone or in small adventuring parties among the Stonelands and Goblin Marches spying on goblinoid tribes, spotting secret Zhentarim outposts, and disrupting the operations of Cormyr's enemies.

These dogged heroes learn to avoid danger without losing sight of their duty. Stealth and survival skills are critical to the Royal Scouts' success. Consequently, most royal scouts are rangers, although several aristocrats, fighters, and rogues have also become members of the Royal Scouts.

Royal Scouts can be encountered anywhere in the Dragonreach and along the Dragon Coast, but they are most likely to be found in Cormyr proper, especially the Forest Kingdom's frontier lands - the Plains of Tun, the Goblin Marches, and the Stonelands."

The king of Cormyr from 1336 DR to 1371 DR and member of the Purple Dragon Knights, Azoun Obarskyr IV is a legend. During his reign, the kingdom experienced unprecedented economic growth. He was killed in the Goblin War by Nalavarauthatoryl.

Azoun's court in Suzail was famous across the realms for its refinement. The King was an avid patron of the arts, a poet, a musician, and he especially loved drama. In his youth, however, Azoun was a rebel who cared nothing for  politics and while he remained an idealist and dutiful King as he grew older, he was much more content to be in battle. Despite the risks to himself, he participated in every battle and became an experienced and talented tactician who used his troops, their skills, his enemies' weaknesses, and the terrain to every advantage.

Surviving countless assassination attempts, King Azoun was never unarmed, he often had a long silver magical +4 dagger tucked away in his boot, along with other magical items ready for every occasion."

#descr "In 1336 DR, when Azoun IV took the throne, Vangerdahast was appointed the Royal Magician of Cormyr and Master of the Council of Mages.

Vangerdahast was a shrewd yet paranoid man: he simply had to know everything that was going on in the realm, all the time—and influence it, often using the War Wizards as a servant force in that regard. He influenced them too, removing the hierarchy that may have promoted internal competition and instead assigned them all to various task forces, all of which reported directly to him. His legacy lived on, even though he had retired, with many of the War Wizards remaining capable spies.

It was common knowledge in Cormyr that Vangerdahast had a longstanding grudge against Elminster, though the origin of the feud was unknown.

Vangerdahast possessed the staff of the High Wizard of Cormyr and the blade Symylazarr, the Fount of Honor. There were several glowstones in Vangerdahast's belt, which he could use as sources of light. There was also a hollow metal sphere that, upon spoken command, could transform into a key to unlock a secret vault in the depths of the royal palace. It was one of only five, the others possessed by the king, queen, and princesses."

#descr "Drow, also known as dark elves, deep elves, night elves, and the Dark Ones among orcs, were a dark-skinned sub-race of elves that predominantly lived in the Underdark. They were hated and feared due to their cruelty, though some non-evil and an even smaller number of good drow existed. 

The church of Lolth was the primary drow faith. Its goal was to strengthen Lolth and her authority by bringing all drow under the church's wing, while killing those who were in any way a challenge to the authority of the Spider Queen and her clergy.

Though religion played a large part in drow society, the caste system and other seemingly lawful aspects of the culture clashed with Lolth's intent and directives as a chaotic evil goddess. As a result, much of the tension between the clergy of Lolth and more secular drow came from this very different perspective."

#descr "This hunched giant exudes power and a crude, stupid anger, its filthy fur clothing bespeaking a brutish and backwoods lifestyle.

Hill giants are barely more intelligent than animals, and their animalistic nature is particularly evident in battle. They intimidate opponents with bearlike posturing, and possess wolflike tactics, often chasing their victims for a short time to wear them down before killing them. It is perhaps unsurprising, then, that hill giants commonly raise wolves as hunting companions, as well as other beasts native to the region that prove both loyal and useful.

Religion is a relatively unimportant fixture in hill giant society, though each tribe tends to have its own origin story. Those tribes that do practice religion usually do so in the form of shamanism or through primitive superstitions, and many make living sacrifices to their brutal gods."

Similarly, drow had a higher than normal tolerance for poison due to exposure over the course of countless generations. Drow had tremendous resistance to magic, with adults overcoming magic around half the time. Drow also had a natural aptitude for audible mimicry, the entire race possessing the capacity to easily imitate the sound and tone of another person in a believable manner, especially if frequently exposed to the language they were using.

All of this made for a race uniquely tuned for clandestine operations and deep infiltration, despite their striking appearance."

Equal parts hideous and heinous, hags embodied what it meant to be ugly inside and out, taking on the forms of unsightly old women. They were the antithesis of Feywild natives like the eladrin, for they were warped reflections of civilized beings that epitomized nature at its most repugnant.

The powers of hags were as variable as they were, but there were several common abilities between them. The decrepit frame of hags belied their supernatural strength and swiftness, for the crones could crush smaller beings one-handed and easily jump obstructions in their path. They all had magic to some degree, commonly being capable of creating illusions to hide their true forms, and they themselves were naturally resistant to magic. In addition, hags often knew curses and other wicked rites that allowed them to scry, prophesize, manipulate the weather, and place curses on those that annoyed them."

They were excellent swimmers and often made their lairs in submerged caves or underground chambers near swamps or murky ponds. Their lairs always had two entrances: one underwater through the adjacent swamp or pond, and one above-ground, disguised amidst the undergrowth.

#descr "Black dragons were not noted as good parents, relying more upon disguise and hiding to protect their eggs than upon guarding them personally. Black dragon eggs must be submerged in strong acid while growing, which helped protect the dragon as well. Black dragons would only protect their young so long as that responsibility didn't threaten their own life. If they had to choose between saving their own life or those of their clutch or spawn, they would most certainly choose the former; though they would assuredly seek revenge afterwards.

New mechanics: Bigger, stronger, more health, thicker scales, more diverse magic, but also a bit slower now, with more popkill and higher upkeep. Mature dragons are capable of laying eggs through their Mating Ritual. Twiceborn rituals placed on this dragon will allow it to become a Dracolich upon death."

They put up a front of diplomacy and deceit when dealing with stronger foes, but they revealed their cruel and petty nature when intimidating lesser beings or when gaining the upper hand. They delighted in stalking their enemies and listening in for any information they could gather before moving to attack. Green dragons especially enjoyed corrupting or consuming elves and fey creatures.

#descr "Green dragons valued their territory, but only as a means to gain as much power as possible without expending considerable effort. They would sometimes trade safe passage for a worthy item to add to their hoards. Even so, they were extremely cunning and duplicitous foes, and loved double-crossing others. A traveler who stumbled into a green dragon's territory might be able to bribe the dragon for safe passage, but more often than not the dragon would pretend to agree and then attack the unsuspecting offender once their guard was down. Worse, if the traveler impressed the green dragon during its stay, they might start thinking of the newcomer as a prized possession to be corrupted and sculpted to its will.

Several new mechanics now come into play:
To grow up and begin laying their own eggs, Juveniles need to acquire 51 XP. 
This can be passively gained over many turns (all units gain a standard +1 XP per turn), or you can take the Juvenile out into combat. 
There may be additional tricks to boost this, but not via items as the Juvenile Dragon has no item slots yet.
Juvenile dragons drain a region of population (10 pop per turn) and gold (-5 per turn).

They were infamous for tricking desert travelers into drinking sand or going miles out of their way to avoid nonexistent dust basins. Their breath weapon was a line of lightning or a large electrical discharge.

#descr "Blue dragons were native to arid wastelands and deserts. They made their lairs in underground caves; easily accessible to the dragons, as they could burrow through the ground. These dragons would fly above their territory, using the bleak landscape and its sparse terrain features as their best chance of spotting opponents. The typical blue dragon lair was dug into one of the towering rock formations that dominate desert landscapes. As with all dragon lairs, the blue dragon's lair would have two entrances: one at ground level and hidden by the sand, and one opening onto a high ledge on which it could perch and survey its territory. Each lair also had a large subterranean cavern with a large pool of water and a sandy beach, which its inhabitant would use for drinking and relaxation.

Several new mechanics now come into play:

#name "Juvenile White Dragon"
#descr "White dragons (also known as ice dragons or glacial wyrms) were the weakest and most feral of the classic chromatic dragons. They made their homes in frozen lands and ice-covered mountains. Their lairs often contained many more tunnels and chambers than those of other chromatic dragons. More powerful white dragons would sometimes turn a large iceberg into a floating lair. Such lairs always had an underwater entrance as well as one to the open air. 

White dragons expelled a cone of intense cold, a direct hit from which was fatal as it instantly froze its victim. Even a glancing blow could be seriously debilitating.

Several new mechanics now come into play:
To grow up and begin laying their own eggs, Juveniles need to acquire 51 XP. 
This can be passively gained over many turns (all units gain a standard +1 XP per turn), or you can take the Juvenile out into combat. 
There may be additional tricks to boost this, but not via items as the Juvenile Dragon has no item slots yet.
Juvenile dragons drain a region of population (10 pop per turn) and gold (-5 per turn).

#descr "White dragons were not strong combatants as dragons went, but they were not to be underestimated. Their icy breath could freeze an unprepared foe solid in an instant. They typically avoided fights with more powerful dragons, but would avail themselves of any opportunity to take their frustrations out on 'lesser' creatures. 

Egg Laying: there will be a new summoning spell - White Dragon Mating Ritual. Eggs are immobile and quite vulnerable for 6 months.
Additionally, Young Adult dragons possess some magic, have less stealth than juveniles, kill more population each turn, and require more upkeep. 3 item slots are now available. Additionally, all adult dragons are female to prevent seduction. If you want to steal a dragon, you have to do it while they are hatchlings or juveniles. Level up at 251 XP."

#descr "Whites also had exceptional memories, and would often hunt down beings who crossed them, no matter how long it might take. They were not as cruel as black dragons and were not as ferocious as reds, but they were still competent in combat.

White dragons preferred to attack first, then eat their prey, rather than pausing to ask questions. They did not often contemplate what to eat, simply choosing the most convenient prey, and would often freeze it after the kill by burying it in snow or ice for days.

New mechanics: Bigger, stronger, more health, thicker scales, more diverse magic, but also a bit slower now, with more popkill and higher upkeep. Mature dragons are capable of laying eggs through their Mating Ritual. Twiceborn rituals placed on this dragon will allow it to become a Dracolich upon death.

He was named He Who Never Sleeps for he was said to never tire, and symbolized with an ever-open eye to represent the orc belief that he watched over them all, judging the worth of each and every one of their kind.

Shamans of Gruumsh, among other requirements, could never lose a personal battle, suffering instant death at their deity's hand if they did. The loss of the tribe in battle meant the loss in power of the shaman, which could be regained by successful conquest later on. Furthermore, they could never use curative spells on anyone but themselves. Despite this high price of office, orcish shamans were highly favoured by Gruumsh in his effort to outdo other deities, and the rigors of shamanic status had some compensation. Firstly they were given extra favor that made them tougher than they would normally be, and second were trained extensively with weapons, making them as equally competent fighters as they were shamans."

Alhoons (also called illithiliches) are illithids that choose to focus on developing arcane abilities in addition to their psionic ones, and have grown powerful enough in magic to become undead liches. Alhoons are generally pariahs in illithid society because they go against most illithids' eventual goal: to merge with the Elder Brain, both physically and psionically. Alhoons, on the other hand, are more concerned with their own personal survival. When discovered near illithid communities, Alhoons are mercilessly hunted down.

The Beast Lord may not evolve into an Elder Brain, like the other Illithids, due to its undead nature."

#descr "Like other goblinoids, goblins often had a short temper, and were more easily provoked than individuals of most other races. They often found it difficult to overcome this short fuse, and had a sense of greed that made it difficult for them to act altruistically. They also generally took sadistic pleasure in exacting revenge once crossed.

Young goblins were taught from an early age to rely only on themselves, and that to survive, they needed to be aggressive and ruthless. To a goblin, it didn't seem logical to treat others as well or better than you would treat yourself; rather, they believed in preemptively removing potential rivals before they could become a threat. Expatriated goblins would sometimes try to recreate the circumstances of their culture, preying on the weaknesses of others in non-goblin communities.

Goblin Dead-eyes wielded shortbows, and though they were not strong, they were plenty accurate enough to cause panic on the front lines."

Javelins were the weapon of choice for many aarakocra, so much so that they developed their own unique type of javelin called a flight lance. A single aarakocra could comfortably carry up to six javelins at a time, stored in a special sheathe that was strapped to its body. Other weapons used by aarakocra included darts and daggers.

Preferring to kill their prey slowly, haunting their dreams night after night, these hags trap the tormented souls of their victims within dark gems so they might be sold in the infernal markets of the outer planes.

Both diabolical and destructive, night hags combined the most despicable traits from fiends throughout the lower planes with the insidious nature of their sinister sisterhood. From their hag side they adopted the desire to sow misery and malcontent in the hearts of mortals everywhere, particularly through the method of bargaining. Like devils, they harbored an indomitable megalomania and unbreakable ambition, crossed with the overpowering need for carnage more typically found in demons.

Among the most infamous Night Hags were a coven known as The Sewn Sisters who aided the demilich Acererak in constructing the Soulmonger. They also acted as nurses to an enslaved atropal, protecting it while it consumed the souls of those resurrected both in the present and the past. Together, Acererak and his three hags, Widow Groat, Baggy Nanna and Peggy Deadbells, brought on the Death Curse and nearly the end of Faerun."

Afterward, in −2809 DR, Oyai led the peoples of the Tabaxi, Eshowe, Thinguth, and several others who'd accepted the faith of Ubtao to follow Ecatzin and the couatls across the ocean to Chult. There, she ruled as the first Negus Negusti - queen of queens.

Afterwards, Ubtao personally selected the rest of seven barae from among the citizens of Mezro sometime after he created that holy city in −2637 DR. He originally appointed them to assist him in dealing with the petty issues of ruling the city of Mezro, but when he continued to grow weary of the people's fickle demands, he left Chult altogether and passed the rule and defense of the city to the barae."

#fixedname "Ras Nsi"
#descr "Ras Nsi was a Barae of Ubtao. One of the seven Chosen of Ubtao, by 1372 DR, he was the only one of the original barae still alive. He was most famous for seeking bloody and violent revenge against the Eshowe tribe of Chult and for his creation of most of the undead that roam the Chultan peninsula. The means by which he undertook his crusade against the Eshowe, despite their guilt in attacking Mezro, was seen as sacrilege. Nsi was banished by the other 6 Barae and he remains in exile to this day, roaming the peninula in disguise and building an army of the undead to protect it one day when called upon.

Several times, Ras Nsi has in fact died, only to be resurrected again by followers, or even possibly by Ubtao itself."

It was the Night Serpent who brought about the end of the Blue Age and ushered in the Shadow Epoch by devouring the sun and plunging Toril into darkness and freezing temperatures.

In the jungles of Chult, worshippers of Ubtao called her 'Eater of the World.' According to their mythos, Ubtao, who was also a primordial, betrayed his kind and trapped Dendar beneath an iron door in the Peaks of Flame. In exchange for his deed, the gods promised never to extend their dominion into the Chultan subcontinent. While imprisoned, however, Dendar has continued to feed. Should Ubtao ever fall, or should he and his followers fail to keep Dendar imprisoned, the world of Toril will almost certainly be consumed by the Eater of the World."

#descr "A wemic was a creature with the upper body of a humanoid and the lower body of a lion. Like centaurs, they had six limbs and were considered 'tauric. creatures. Wemics were larger and stronger than humans, and could make great leaps with a running start. Both their humanoid hands and feline feet bore claws, with their fore claws being extremely sharp. 

They had keen eyesight, including darkvision, and exceptional hearing. A nomadic species, they that did not make settled homes, but formed patriarchal prides, following the herds they hunted for food. Their prides were typically served by a spiritual leader, often a druid. Sometimes, a number of prides would band together to form a single tribe, led by a chieftain. During times of imminent danger, a number of prides united into a nation, and a king was chosen from among the chieftains of the prides to rule over the greater collective. Such a congregation, however, is exceedingly rare.

Some wemics lived solitary lives, like those found in the Dalelands, and shepherded flocks of sheep and other livestock through the region's rolling pastures. Others would hire themselves out as mercenaries, trackers or wilderness guides, often seeking magical weapons as compensation for their services."

#name "Minotaur Brute"
#descr "Minotaurs were a strong and combative race of monstrous humanoids resembling bull–human hybrids. They were rare in Faerûn, outside of their labyrinth homes in the Underdark.

Minotaurs were always ravenously hungry, a trait that only fueled their aggression. Happy to eat the flesh of humans or other sentient creatures, they had little appetite for parlay. Fortunately, minotaurs were not highly intelligent. Their instinctive cunning made them adept at ambush attacks but in general, minotaurs preferred melee combat and utilized little to no armor for they were not adept craftspeople. The sound of rending flesh, breaking bones, and the scent of blood, sent minotaurs into a frenzy - a truly terrifying prospect.

A few Minotaurs made their way to civilization to work as mercenaries, guards, and more than a few rose to fame as gladiators. Keeping them fed was the real challenge."

#name "Minotaur Elder"
#descr "A typical minotaur leader, also known as the elder, was the biggest and strongest bull in the tribe, though rarely did that include the most intelligent. The tribe's elder led his fellow bulls into raids and because of his breeding demands, solitary minotaurs were a common occurrence. Most clans had no more than eight members.

Their youth were taught to fight and master weapons at an early age. In minotaur society, combat education was led by the Elder, and those who sought to limit this educaiton in the interests of self-preservation were ruthlessly hunted by the priest class. Minotaur children spent most of their time wrestling and fighting each other and calves developed brutal and cruel rivalries from earliest childhood. These feuds were often encouraged by the adults, further strengthening the herd."

Other spellcasters were not respected in Halruaan society, so few of them ever stayed in their homeland long enough to attain the level of talent necessary to become a member of the Council.

Although the 400-plus members of the council were proven wizards, being an arcane spellcaster was not enough to hold authority in Halruaa. After passing a divinatory background check, they had to prove their mastery of the Art with unique displays of arcane force and knowledge, enough to make them famous all across the land.

Such individuals that achieved this feat, and earned the title of a 'Halruaan Elder', were granted permission to participate in the nation's revered and prestigious ruling council. This assembly served as the court of the Netyarch, where the group discussed the official policies and important matters of the country with the head of state."

No wizards were beyond their authority or reach, including the Council who oversaw their actions. Because of this authority, magehounds lived a solitary and lonely lifestyle, being feared and shunned by their arcane brethren. Despite this, magehounds would keep some associates with complimentary skills to assist in their hunts.

The most powerful from among their ranks were capable of developing antimagic fields, in order to help them contain rogue spellcasters."

For Halruaans the true path of magic was that of wizardry, and because of that, from at least 1372 DR, sorcerers were frowned upon and considered dangerous individuals, and most of them chose to leave Halruaa instead of downplaying their abilities.

Thanks to their emphasis in magic, Halruaans were highly educated. Children attended public schools until the age of thirteen, and this also served to search for potential wizards among them. They learned to use cantrips as part of their studies."

Life in the cities of Halruaa was touched by magic in many ways. Their houses had at least a few built-in magical enhancements, such as magical street lamps, while a favorite practice in cities along the coast was to produce 'walls' of magically coaxed coral, via the coral growth spell. Spells that produced sparkling lights and pleasing sounds were often woven into fine fabrics to enhance their beauty. Fanciful means of travel, such as carpets of flying or skyships, were commonplace. Everywhere in Halruaa, people took great pains to show off their abilities as well as their wealth.

This magical economy was fuelled by Halruaan Artificers, specializing in the crafting of magical items, arms, and armor."

#descr "The Jordaini are a special servitor caste, though still upper class, in the magocracy of Halruaa. They are trained at a young age to understand magic and to protect themselves against magic but without its use. Instead, they are schooled in a wide range of academic and martial disciplines and taught to be imperturbable in the face of the wondrous. Following their graduation from House Jordain, they are assigned to one of Halruaa's ruling class of wizards, where their special skills make them important advisors to and guardians of their new masters. 

Most jordain viziers begin their training as experts, and then apply their abilities to the monk class until qualifying as a jordain vizier, whereupon they typically alternate between monk and jordain vizier levels. Members of the jordain order usually multiclass as experts, fighters, jordain viziers, and monks, but some multiclass as rogues. Few take up spellcasting classes, since doing so inevitably makes them hunted by the magehounds.

Jordain viziers approach adventures as unflappably as they approach everything else. While most jordain viziers are found away from their homes only when they accompany their masters on important missions, a few flee Halruaa due to a breech of their ethical code or to find freedom. Such renegades are hunted persons, likely to surround themselves with likeminded allies and be always on the move."

In addition to receiving bonuses to summoning creatures of all kinds, he will also be accompanied in each battle by one of his loyal and trusty best friends - a Behir, of course. 

There is a small chance (8 percent) that Kholstar will summon a Behir so long as he is in friendly dominion.  

The behir is a serpentine monster that can slither like a snake or use its dozen legs to move with considerable speed. A full size behir is about 40 feet long and weighs about 4,000 pounds. It can fold its limbs close to its long, narrow body and slither in snake fashion if it desires. The coloration of behirs ranges from ultramarine to deep blue with bands of gray-brown. The belly is pale blue. The two large horns curving back over the head look dangerous but are actually used for preening the creature’s scales, not for fighting.

A behir usually bites and grabs its prey first, then either swallows or constricts the opponent. It can employ its claws only against foes caught in its coils. If beset by a large number of foes, a Behir may also use its breath weapon."

These warriors acted as commanding officers of Thayan soldiers, defenders of Thayan enclaves all over Faerûn, and as personal bodyguards to Red Wizards. They were knights only in name, as they did not have any code of conduct. The only rule to which they adhered was that their life was of no importance compared to the safety of the Red Wizards, whom they were sworn to protect. Failure to fulfill this duty was severely and painfully punished.

To become a Thayan knight, a skilled human warrior had to be born in Thay, possess significant martial abilities, and swear absolute allegiance to the Red Wizards. Non-humans were prohibited from joining their ranks and neither slaves nor barbarians were permitted into their ranks.

To defray their high resource cost, recruit Mulan Oppressors to boost local production."

#descr "Szass Tam was a powerful lich and a member of the eight Zulkirs who ruled the country of Thay. After the Civil War of the Zulkirs, he reigned as the Regent of Thay. He was the Zulkir of Necromancy and commanded Cyric's Legion and the Legion of Bone, a huge army of undead soldiers, led by his vampire and lich generals. Szass Tam's seat of power was the Citadel on the Thaymount.

''Szass Tam's dreams are finally coming true. He has walked the Paths of the Doomed and gone unscathed past the Devouring Portal. His destiny lies beneath the Thaymount, and when he looks to the future he sees all of Faerûn turned into a great charnel house, full of undead creatures which do his bidding. The other zulkirs have only one choice – follow him, willingly or unwillingly. Those who do so willingly are to be rewarded. Those who do not, lose both life and soul, and become Szass Tam's slaves. He means to do this, believe me. Seek the Paths of the Doomed, and you will see what I speak of.''

#name "Mulan Oppressor"
#descr "Mulan were a generally arrogant, conservative group, resistant to change and convinced of their cultural superiority over all others. In Thay, many even believed they were above the gods. Mulan felt they were more civilized, inventive, and capable than other ethnic groups and believed strongly in the values of order and discipline. All upper- and middle-class Mulan received at least some education, and apprenticeship at a young age was common. Mulan followed the rigid class structures of their society, and the practice of slavery was commonplace. They also had a strong tradition in the use of magic, but disagreed over the pursuit of arcane versus divine magic.

There have been countless Mulan Oppressors over the centuries. These men are typically political elites: nobles, wealthy oligarchs, and warlords. All are slave masters and well suited to pressing their captives into military service. They are also excellent at extending the coffers of the realms they inhabit."

They were also chaotic, fickle, and concerned for their own safety; it was not unknown for them to flee when the tide of battle turned against them.

In the mid-to-late 14th century DR, black unicorns were known to be a mainstay of the Thayan military, and served in it in large numbers. They were the most notorious element of the Thayan cavalry, and were almost always ridden into battle by women. One prominent regiment of black unicorn riders were the Sisters of Cyric. 

Black unicorns, like their more peaceful kin, had multiple magical abilities. These included immunities to poison, the ability to become invisible three times per day, and the ability to teleport their rider over short distances. Their single, black and silver horn was highly poisonous and caused paralysis and eventual heart failure.

The Sisters of Cyric were a Thayan cavalry regiment active in the mid-to-late 14th century DR. Every member was an evil priestess of Cyric who rode into battle on a black unicorn. The Sisters served Aznar Thrul, the Zulkir of Evocation and Tharchion of the Priador."

#descr "A darkenbeast, also called a death horror or dark horror, was an artificial magical beast created by evil spellcasters. The darkenbeast attacked by diving down from the air with a combination of fang and talon. They were immune to any form of mental magic, only obeying the telepathic commands of the caster, who could give limited orders based on mental images. They were remarkably durable and treated themselves as expendable during any combat situation, requiring their masters to consciously pull them out of pointless melee. 

The Red Wizards of Thay were well known for their use of darkenbeasts against the people of Rashemen. Circa 1362 DR, a Red Wizard named Maligor used alteration magic to shapeshift hundreds if not thousands of wild animals into darkenbeasts to be used as bloodhounds."

Dwarves were unusually tough for humanoids, in more ways than one. Dwarven stomachs, for instance, were resistant to virtually all poisons and it took less effort for a dwarf to get back on their feet than other races. Dwarves also had dense bodies and were difficult to push around as a result, as well as having the capacity to bear loads that other races might find hindering with little ill effect. Dwarves also had a sense about them that few races did, with a preternatural awareness of their surroundings useful for a subterranean race as well as good judgment all-around in general. 

Dwarven Miners are typically recruited by slavers, but even when recruited in friendly lands, their labor standards aren't much better."

He first appeared in Toril alongside the rest of the Untheric pantheon when the slaves the Imaskari brought from Earth also brought the worship of their deities with them. With help from Ao, these deities were able to follow their worshipers and end their servitude. 

The original patriarch of the Untheric pantheon, Enlil, abdicated his position in −734 DR, making Gilgeam the new leader of the pantheon. It has been, throughout the centuries, an abusive relationship. Gilgeam has long battled with Tiamat, their avatars having each defeated the other numerous times as they sought power and influence in Unther.

Recent years have seen a growing resistance movement to the tyrannical and oppressive rule of Gilgeam, especially as his arbitrary nature has led to a series of vindictive laws limiting the other gods of the Untheric pantheon. Popular revolts have been brewing for centuries and Gilgeam's loyal lapdog-beuraucrats fear telling him the truth of the situation. 

Gilgeam had dominion over Air, Strength, Tyranny and War. Among his methods of maintaining power were the use of demon binding and necromancy."

#descr "Horus-Re was the leader of the Mulhorandi pantheon. Known by the name Helcaliant in Thay and Hokatep in Unther, he was an honorable deity that opposed change. As a young and willful deity, Horus often sided with Anhur in pressing for changes and reforms. His father, Re, staunchly disapproved. But when Re was defeated by Gruumsh during the Orcgate Wars, the dying deity passed his powers and domain to Horus. Upon gaining this power, Horus became Horus-Re and began exhibiting the personality traits and beliefs of the dead god. He understood why Anhur posed a threat to the sacred order of things and would often ally with Isis, Osiris and Thoth to oppose Anhur's aims. Most of all, however, Horus-Re was intent on thwarting his divine nemesis, Set.

Like all mortalized gods, if Horus-Re dies in battle, he will reform but often with consequences to the strength of his essence. Dying too often will kill even the gods unless they can return to their home realm in the Outer Planes to be restored - a journey the still-active Imaskari Barrier prevents for all the gods of Mulhorand."

#descr "Thoth, known as Tholaunt in Thay and Thalatos in Unther, was the scribe and historian of the Mulhorandi pantheon. He was an intellectual deity known for academic debate and innovation. Thoth usually appeared as a slender Mulan male possessing the head of an ibis.

The will of Thoth was often communicated through the actions and appearance of constructs, golems, and animals. The Sacred Ibis were his eyes and ears across the far reaches of Mulhorand and he often drew the attention of his followers to important information through the call of the ibis. Thoth possessed the ability to fly at will and could negate magical effects as he chose.

Thoth was closely allied to Horus-Re, Isis and Osiris and had good relations with most of the deities native to Faerun. Only Set was considered an enemy, though the Red Wizards of Thay were often a close second.

Thoth is immortal within Mulhorand's dominion, but requires time to transmigrate to a new host body. If The City of the Gods falls, Thoth will cease to exist. Because each time a Mulhorandi deity dies its essence loses potency, the gods prefer to remain passive when it comes to the state of the empire. Even war does not concern the gods so long as the battles do not threaten the City of the Gods itself."

While this often put him into conflict with Horus-Re, who desired an unchanging world, both Isis and Osiris worked closely with Anhur to ensure the security of the realms. The center of power of the church of Anhur was located in Sultim, the location of the Blood Fortress. Worship of the Falcon of War was strongest in Mulhorand, but temples dedicated to Anhur could also be found in Unther and Chessenta.  He typically appeared as a Mulan human with four arms, red skin, and dark eyes. His hair appeared dark, and he usually had a short beard that was often braided.

Anhur is immortal within Mulhorand's dominion, but requires time to transmigrate to a new host body. If The City of the Gods falls, he will cease to exist. Each time a Mulhorandi deity dies its essence loses potency. Many of the gods therefore prefer to remain passive when it comes to the mundane conflicts of the empire.

Set had negotiated alliances with Tiamat, as well as with the dragon Maldraedior.

Set's Clerics spend their time overseeing criminal activities, especially grave-robbing and insurrection.

The secret center of the church of Set was the Cavern of the Jackal, located beneath the city of Sampranasz. Temples dedicated to Set were usually subterranean, and always hidden."

#copyspr 1349  
#name "The Smiling Death"
#descr "Sebek, known as Sebethant in Thay and as Sebakar in Unther and Chessenta, was a jealous, vain, and evil member of the Mulhorandi pantheon. The Lord of Crocodiles was a member of low-standing, yet rivaled only by Set in his wickedness.

When he manifested in Faerun, he came in one of two forms - either a Mulan male with the head of a crocodile, or as a massive, smiling crocodile-headed lion. He often came to Faerun to hunt and to spread the blessing (or curse if you opposed his savage nature) of lycanthropy. 

Malar and Sebek often came into conflict as they shared one-another's dominion over lycanthropes."

#name "Lord of the Afterlife"
#fixedname "Osiris"
#descr "Osiris was a member of the Mulhorandi pantheon. He was the god of the dead and death itself, responsible for meting out justice in the afterlife. He was also a god of plant life, especially as it related to the harvest of food. Osiris was husband of Isis, father of Horus-Re, and the brother of Thoth. All who defiled the peaceful and natural repose of teh dead were his enemies, but most especially Set."  

The position of priest in the church of Osiris was usually hereditary; members typically belonged to the House of Osriant, and could claim at least one divine incarnation of Osiris among their ancestors. Perhaps because of this, his devoted worshippers were relatively few in number. Priests of Osiris spent much of their time traveling Mulhorand and settling minor disputes, often around inheritance. Most importantly, they presided over burial procedures and maintained guards and wards in tombs throughout the realm.

The principle temples of the church of Osiris were the Crypt of Shadows located in Jhalhoran and the Gateway to the Afterworld, which was located in Mishtan. Many crypts in Mulhorand also contained shrines dedicated to the Judge of the Dead."

#descr "The Seneschal is an important royal or state-appointed officer in charge of justice and in control of the administration of a province. In Kingdoms, this officer is likely a replacement for an unruly or unreliable local lord and must come with all the power and authority of the King when dealing with vigilante Houses. In Mercantile City-States, the Seneschal has much the same duties but with added emphasis on economic output and the free flow of vital trade goods from outlying territorial holdings. In both cases, the Seneschal's professionalism is beyond reproach and her tolerance for nitwits and naysayers is dangerously low. 

Expect her Defense Organizer, Income Generation, and Tax-Collector abilities to come in handy. She also attracts Retired War Heroes so long as she is within her nation's dominion. She is a good leader and she can defend herself in a pinch. As a member of a City-State, her 'holiness' is her dedication to the nation's vision and represents the common tactics used by her home realm."

#descr "Tchazzar was a red dragon mythic sovereign. He most often took the form of a human male to mask his true identity. 

Little is known about Tchazzar's life until he began on the path to godhood, only that his father was Rauthstokh, an old red wyrm who died well before his son matured. In 929 DR he forged an alliance between several Chessentan cities and led them in a rebellion against Unther. The rebellion was successful and Chessenta seceded from Unther to form its own nation. 

Tchazzar was crowned king, and set up a temple to himself in an effort to achieve his ultimate goal of divinity. In 1018 DR he rode alone to battle with raiding Sahuagin but his body was never found. Tchazzar had actually taken on his true dragon form and slain the Sahuagin en mass. He then sent visions of himself standing atop the pile of their smoldering corpses to the throne and council chambers of all Chessentan cities. This inspired Chessentans into even greater religious fervor for him, ensuring that the church of Tchazzar remained intact. Choosing to remain aloof to the nation he helped create and focus on his faith and nascent apotheosis from afar, Chessenta fell into centuries of cyclical civil wars and reconciliations, all the while managing to remain independent with Tchazzar's clandestine assistance. 

During the Time of Troubles, Gilgeam slew Tiamat, Goddes of Dragons, and her divinity was split into three parts, each coming to inhabit a great wyrm. Tchazzar was one, with Gestaniuss and Skuthosiin the others. To truly ascend, Tchazzar will need to first find and defeat his rivals."

The family has run Eltorchul Academy for three decades now, having slowly elevated it into an elite bastion of noble scions and the children of the well-to-do.

In the Year of the Banner (1368 DR), Lord Thesp's son and heir, Oth Eltorchul, was left a babbling husk after dabbling in the creation of dream spheres with the Mhaorkiira Hadryad. Fallout from the dream spheres affair nearly bankrupted the family, forcing them to open the doors of Eltorchul Academy to all manner of students willing and able to pay. As a result, current students and recent graduates of Eltorchul Academy vary widely in talent, ability, social status, and outlook. 

The school pays for the expensive material components related to crafting magical arms and armor and encourages students to sell the resulting items to pay for the increasing tuition costs. This has led many students unable to afford the tuition to engage in risky arcane crafting practices. Upon graduation, many find their way into adventuring groups."

Temples to the Lord of Battle looked more like military fortresses than the archetypal temple. They featured barracks, mess halls, armories, and training grounds.

Due to its tendency to have followers and priests on both sides of any engagement, the church of Tempus had no central authority that might support one side or the other exclusively. Within a given temple or order, however, there was a strict hierarchy and chain of command."

The most benevolent of druids could take on the forms of pegasi or even unicorns.

An owlbear was a large magical or fey beast that looked like a cross between an owl and a bear. Notoriously aggressive and ferocious, they were among the most feared predators in the wilderness. More cunning than an owl, these creatures were incredibly aggressive and obstinate and were famous for their ferocity and foul temper. They would go so far as to attack almost anything that moved — anything larger than a mouse and anything they thought they could kill — on sight and without any provocation. They hunted so heavily because of their insatiable appetites, more than that of a giant owl and a bear combined. A hungry owlbear feared nothing, not even superior strength and size or any other discouragement or obstacle or impediment, and with little instinct for self-preservation, they would fight to the death. Only one that had already fed well was disinclined to attack a superior foe or risk its life. However, an owlbear's ferocity was also its key weakness — they could be easily lured into a trap or tricked into charging off a cliff, if available."

Those half-elves living deeper in the Yuirwood were more in touch with their elven ancestry, preferring to live the elven way in small communities or as hunter-gatherers. 

Most half-elves either supported or accepted the human presence in Aglarond, but there was rumored to be a small group who were in favor of wiping them out. Magic among the half-elves was widely practiced, especially among the inhabitants of the deeper Yuirwood.

It was from this population that the Yuirwood Rangers were drawn. Champions of freedom and masters of the forest, they were a vital part of Aglaronds ability to defend itself from outsiders."

The church of Valkur was very loosely organized. Many clerics served as captains or sailors aboard ships and they usually met each other only if they happened to serve on the same ship or be in the same port. The clergy was known for helping sailors who were down on their luck.

Their only Order was known as the Calming Wave. Founded by a group of pirates from the Sea of Swords who abandoned their worship of Umberlee after a particularly dangerous storm, they believed that they survived by Valkur's hand and dedicated their lives to serving their new deity and growing the monastic order."

#descr "Helm is the ultimate guardian, the ever-vigilant sentry who allows nothing to compromise his duty. Often seen as cold and emotionless, he appears as a giant man in full plate armor. In truth, Helm is simply a stern disciplinarian dedicated to his appointed task. He is fond of children and more tolerant of their minor infractions than of anyone else’s. Many believe that Helm would give his own life to guard something entrusted to him. He is silent on the matter. 

The church of Helm was once seen as a bastion of stability and safety in the oft-dangerous North. Its members were highly respected for their pledge to defend civilization against the dangers of the wild and the monsters of the depths. However, during the past fourteen years it has shrunk greatly in numbers and influence. Helm served his duty faithfully and faultlessly during the Time of Troubles, but he played a role in confining the other deities to Faerun. The death and destruction that resulted from the Avatar Crisis earned the Vigilant One and his followers a great deal of enmity from members of other faiths, particularly those of Mystra, Bane, and Torm. In the South, Helm’s role during the Time of Troubles was not viewed as unfavorably as it was in the North, but recent events have further sullied the name of the deity and his clergy. Word has begun to trickle back to Faerun of the church’s activities in far-off Maztica; the brutal and unflinching subjugation of the native populace and the rape of the verdant land’s riches. The church is only just starting to recover, thanks in large parts to the need for skilled guardians to defend against the waxing power of evil."

Torm was one of the three deities of similar interests known as The Triad, along with Ilmater and Tyr. It was often said by common folk that Torm was the weakest of the three in his subservient role, but the role he played was of true importance: he acted as the nexus that held the three together. Torm tempered Tyr's zeal for justice with his gifts of mercy and humility. Torms worshippers, known as Tormtar, were typically paladins and martial clerics, dedicated to defeating the dark gods and other evil powers throughout the realms. 

Torm gained considerable attention and praise during the Time of Troubles, when his faithful helped keep one of the missing Tablets of Fate safe. Torm's own avatar battled and completely destroyed the avatar of Bane outside Tantras on Eleasis 13 in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR. Torm knew he did not have enough power alone to defeat Bane, so he chose to absorb the souls of his worshipers in their holy city of Tantras. This transferring of souls from among his most faithful was done voluntarily and their sacrifice numbered in the thousands. Children were spared and they became known as the Martyrs' Progeny.

Their capital and holy-city of Tantras was situated in The Vast, just west of Impiltur."

#descr "The Spellguard was an organization of powerful, militaristic mages in Silverymoon, who served as the city's protectors, the personal guard of its ruler and patrons of its illustrious college of magical learning. They kept watch over the city's mythal and its protective wards.

The order was open to arcane spellcasters of all sorts; while primarily comprised of wizards, it also included swordmages, sorcerers and warlocks among its ranks. In order to gain admittance, aspiring members had to demonstrate a certain prowess in battle-magic by casting a number of spells while in audience with the Spellguard's Lord Warder. The applicant would be interrogated by the Lord Warder, who was aided by a number of clerics casting divination spells such as detect evil, detect thoughts, discern lies and true seeing. Once they were accepted, Spellguards were formally brought into the order in a grand ceremony held within the High Palace.

Serving within the Spellguard was often a requirement for joining the Conclave of Silverymoon."

She was known for her love and devotion to her people, something especially unusual for many people who hold political power. Therefore, she was extremely popular in Silverymoon, and most of her subjects would do anything in their power to prevent any harm from happening to her. She was a beacon of hope whose fame extended throughout all of Faerun and was widely regarded as the forgotten realm's most beloved ruler.

Born in 762, she and her older sibling Sylune were taken the goddess, Mystra, to foster with Thamator the Old, a legendary member of the Harpers. Though Sylune took quickly to magic, Alustriel did not. She thus led an unhappy childhood, disappointing those around her. Her powers did not manifest until an unwanted advance by a young man brought out her latent talents. She quickly thereafter rose to power and became a well-known adventurer who fought for peace between the races of the Silver Marches. Together, with friends Amaara Nharimur and sister Lynnasha, Alustriel created Silverymoon's famous Moonbridge and established The Conclave. In 857, rulership over Silverymoon was passed to her. In between adventures and battles in the outer planes to help protect the realms, Alustriel has directed the city for roughly 4 centuries."

#name "Dracolich"
#descr "More than a powerful form of undead, a dracolich was a dragon who had voluntarily tied its soul to a phylactery, freeing itself from death. A type of lich, the creature's spirit could possess any dead reptilian body, pulling pieces and bones together to an approximation of their original form. They retained all the powers and abilities of their former draconic body. '...Stripped of life, of hunger, of the needs of the flesh, an undead dragon is simply evil incarnate.'
— Jothan Ironspell

The process of becoming a dracolich was rediscovered by Sammaster the Mad, a fallen Chosen of Mystra, who was inspired after re-translating The Chronicle of Years to Come by the prophet Maglas. He was convinced that Toril would suffer a great apocalypse and 'naught will be left save shattered thrones with no rulers. But the dead dragons shall rule the world entire…' Sammaster's first success was with the great red wyrm Shargrailar the Dark in the Year of the Queen's Tears, 902 DR. Since then, Sammaster and his followers, the Cult of the Dragon, have created many more, preparing for the apocalypse.

Mod Note: Only Mature Dragons and Ancient Dragons who cast the Twiceborn ritual will become Dracoliches. All Dracoliches breathe Dragon Fire."

One of the original objectives of the Knights was said to have been to guard against incursions from Zakhara. Once each century, the dracolich Xavarathimius, the Everlasting Wyrm, would reform itself in the Sharawood and begin amassing riches and followers. Every time this occurred, the Knights of the Eternal Dragon would emerge and utterly destroy the dragon and its followers and steal its hoard for themselves. This cycle seemed doomed to repeat itself until the end of time."

One of the largest incursions of Salamanders into Faerun occured in Thay prior to the Time of Troubles. Known as the Salamander War, Thayan Zulkirs summoned large numbers of Salamanders as a means of waging a war against their enemies on the Sea of Fallen Stars. However, their effort to banish the Salamanders at the conclusion was unsuccessful and the resulting conflict nearly destroyed the Priador.

While they were originally guardians of arcane knowledge and lore, their years of obsessively monitoring foreign mages who traveled to the Merchant's Domain, caused them to gradually transform into a autocratic authority over magic in the nation.

Each Cowled Wizards cell was assigned to each town or city in Amn, isolated in their operations and led by the most powerful arcane spellcaster in the region. Save for times when politics between leaders arose as an issue, individual Cowled Wizards met in the capital of Athkatla in a series of hidden chambers beneath Jann Lane. From these secret rooms, members could organize their operations and reach out to other cells, whether to communicate or join forces with one another.

The Cowled Wizards are immune to the effects of Drain Scales, both in combat from the fatigue penalties of Drain as well as in research."

As ruthless as they were secretive, it didn't take long for the Shadow Thieves to infiltrate every strata of society in Amn. Many citizens relied upon the manipulative and illicit services provided by the Shadow Thieves. Business people became reliant on their protection rackets, money lenders, and the enforcers they hired out. Politicians and government officials would often hire the guild's spies and burglars to obtain guarded knowledge, or plant false information. The multitude of traders and merchants in Amn received a myriad of unique mercantile opportunities provided by the guild's smugglers and pirates.

High ranking members of the Shadow Thieves typically came to worship Bhaal, the God of Murder, or one of the other Dark Gods."

#name "Umberlant Cleric"
#descr "Umberlee is the evil goddess of the oceans, currents, waves, and sea winds. She is one of the Deities of Fury along with Talos, Auril and Malar. Like the church of Talos, the church of Umberlee is almost universally despised and propitiated only out of fear. Nevertheless, despite the promise offered by the relatively weak church of Valkur, nearly every sailor makes an offering to the Bitch Queen before heading into her domain and Umberlant clerics can walk unmolested in dockside wards in most ports. They are even welcomed aboard most ships, in hopes that their presence will help appease the goddess. 

The church of Umberlee is disorganized and run differently in different locales. The only organized hierarchy is that imposed by a particularly favored and powerful cleric, and such regimes are inevitably washed away in time by the ever-fickle Bitch Queen. Clerics of the faith are even given to dueling each other to settle disputes of rank or ability, although such combats are rarely fatal. Instead, the loser is usually thrown aboard the next ship to leave port, regardless of the destination.

Umberlee is one of the Deities of Fury. She serves Talos, along with Auril and Malar. Talos has been encroaching upon her portfolio, and since she lacks the strength to fight him, Umberlee has been trying to distract him with romantic intrigues. She fights Selune and Valkur (to whom sailors pray to bring them home safely), Chauntea (for her dominion over land), and Sune (whose beauty she envies)."

#descr "Demoncysts were pockets of the Abyss. They first appeared circa Year of the Stone Giant, −160 DR, when Eltab was summoned by Narfell to fight in the Great Conflagration against Raumathar. Somehow, this summons also bound pieces of his Abyssal realm, the Hidden Layer, to the Material Plane, and these pieces became scattered across northeast Faerûn.

By the mid 14th century, the tribal peoples who came to inhabit the lands of Old Narfell were unaware of their ancestral heritage, but warlocks from across the realms still flocked to the region in the hopes of conjuring the demonic powers that once fueled the now-lost empire. With careful practice and infernal knowledge, these warlocks believed they could once again bring powerful abyssal entities through the demoncysts and into Faerun and thus take their places at their demon lords' sides at the vanguard of a terrifying, resurgent Nar Empire.

Demoncyst Warlocks seek chaos and power through blood magic and are practiced crossbreeders. While not priests themselves, their infernal pacts give them the blessings of their abyssal masters."

#descr "Demonbiders and worshippers of Yeenoghu are known to summon Quasits.  These demons share the imp powers of invisibility and resistance to both non-magical weaponry and pure magic. A minor regenerative power also made quasits somewhat hard to kill over an extended period of time, and if killed they would reform in the Abyss in a year and a day.

Their talons were coated in a toxin that caused an intensely irritating itch that would render their foes helpless.

The quasit's job was to serve their master well and help them succeed in their endeavors, but this was merely a pretense to their true goal. In truth, quasits sought out arcane magic users with weak wills and strong impulses in a bid to make them behave with greater moral abandon, and eventually turn them into a magical outlet of destruction. The greater havoc their masters wrought the better, although they preferred their malice to target those least likely to already be headed to the Abyss so as to steal their souls first. This rule especially applied to those of lawful evil alignments, so as to prevent Hell's forces from growing in power.

Quasits would continue to serve their mortal master as long as they believed that they could still grow more powerful and commit greater atrocities, only wishing them dead when it became evident they would only become weaker or morally stronger."

They often supervised lesser demonic entities while working as the toadies of more sinister threats. A hezrou's amphibian skin exuded a toxic substance that produced a cloud of noxious gas when they were agitated. They had access to many spell-like abilities, including blasphemy, unholy blight, and chaos hammer. Normal demonic resistances, immunity to non-magical weapons, and telepathy were among their powers.

Hezrous were cunning on the battlefield and could fulfill roles as both powerful warriors and capable sergeants. In battle, they were often responsible for keeping the dretch mobs moving towards the enemy, but the most dangerous hordes had hezrou themselves as the rank-and-file. Once the dretches were fighting, the hezrous followed in their wake.

Hezrous were integral to both the Blood War and the day-to-day proceedings of the Abyss in general. At their core, hezrous functioned as enforcers. They normally patrolled the abyssal layers, enacted the will of their respective demon lords and nalfeshnees, and tyrannically controlled lesser demons like dretches and chasmes."

With their high numbers, dretches could be dangerous threats if they were more intelligent, but alas, they lacked anything that could be regarded as brainpower. They were stupid, slow, quarrelsome, and uncreative creatures, with the main reason for their survival within the Abyss being that they made up an immeasurable horde. They preferred using their sheer numbers to win their battles, their tactics rarely going beyond a mob rush.

The beating of their wings acted as poison and their screeching made even the bravest soldiers flee in terror. Wholly evil, they saw no reason to accept a bargain when they could simply kill the diplomat, take his treasure, and then have the added benefit of sating their need for carnage and having a fresh meal.

A gathering of vrocks was known as a 'Murder' and they were often found in groups of 8 or less, though in times of war were known to organize into squadrons much larger. While excellent bodyguards, they came truly into their own when used as aerial strike teams in mass combat.

Vrocks were easily manipulated due to their greed and love of shiny objects. Clever ones were known to summon and 'buy' the loyal services of other vrocks for little more than baubles and trinkets. They were also capable of summoning dretches in combat.

Despite their physical prowess, glabrezus preferred to work behind the scenes, both on the Prime Material Plane and in the Abyss. Glabrezus took pleasure in the act of temptation, luring all they met with lies, deception, and offers of power before ruining their victims' lives. The secret agendas of a glabrezu were many, their complicated schemes and spiteful plots for vengeance sometimes taking centuries to millennia to finally come to fruition. Furthering their guile was their commanding presence, as they had a strong air of authority they used to enhance their arguments.

Glabrezu come with a number of unique abilities: they can teleport at will, passively produce 3 blood slaves each turn, make excellent blood searchers, and automatically summon 3d6 dretches at the start of battle. They also increase the turmoil scales of any province they are in, which helps to boost their chaos power bonus - giving them increased stats when in provinces with high turmoil.

They are capable of free-summoning Vrocks by command."

They carry flaming whips in one hand and a heart-finding sword in the other, but prefer to begin combat at long range using spells first, then teleporting deep into the enemy's rear to sow chaos and decapitate the enemy leadership.

#descr "Graz'zt was the demon prince of pleasure, decadence, and unlimited self-indulgence, as well as the patron of corrupt authorities and tyrants who would rule by force. The appearance of the The Dark Prince belied the true depths of his wickedness, his existence a warning that not all that was beautiful was also good. All things were but playthings in the eyes of the Prince of Pleasure, he simply hadn't claimed them yet.

Wielding an acid-drenched greatsword in one hand and a profane tower shield in the other, the Dark Prince was a veritable killing machine when loosed upon the hordes of the Abyss. What's more, he had a vast repertoire of magical abilities at his disposal, making him a deadly magical opponent. Graz'zt's greatest weapons, however, were his mastery of seduction and guile. He entertained the notion that he was the most cunning and intelligent creature in the Abyss; indeed, there were few who could possibly contest such a claim.

Although he had not yet achieved divine status, Graz'zt was worshiped on the Material Plane by many monstrous races, most notably the lamias. Many of his high priests, known as the Chosen, were female, and the rituals they performed were violent and involved themes of darkness and betrayal.

Through his own schemings and mischief, Graz'zt became the chief enemy of Waukeen, goddess of wealth and merchantry. During the Time of Troubles, the deity bargained for safe passage through the Abyss in the hopes of returning to her divine plane. Graz'zt betrayed Waukeen as soon as she arrived and imprisoned her and forcing her to witness profane celebrations held in her honor. His followers infiltrated her church and began a heresy that would lead to schism. "

#descr "Barghests were fiendish lupine shapeshifters and the only true natives of Gehenna. They commanded goblinoids and consumed mortal souls to gain power and return to their native Fourfold Furnaces. They left their young in the Realms to forage for themselves. These young tended to live with goblins, and the immature barghests would grow in strength over time, eventually gaining enough power to return to Gehenna. 

Barghests on the Material Plane operated either alone or with a sibling, lurking in remote humanoid communities or joining bands of goblinoids although they weren't opposed to leading other wicked races. Normally they attempted to keep their true nature hidden for as long as possible, devouring the occasional goblin when given the opportunity until old enough to find more promising prey and too obvious remain inconspicuous. Goblins sycophantically worshiped barghests, each pathetically trying to demonstrate its worth to its host in order to avoid the ire and hunger of their new masters. Barghests typically retained their goblinoid forms when leading such tribes, existing in a strange and cruel symbiosis with their goblin host. So long as the goblins could please the barghest with gifts and sacrifices the barghests would protect the tribe from threats and bolster their hoards, with bugbear barghests in particular leading murderous raids on villages.

Bound Barghests make excellent bloodhunters."

Existing solely to spread death and destruction, atropals roamed across the planes, hunting down any prey that came their way. Others were sealed away in forgotten delves.

The atropals spewed obscenities, stuck in perpetual state of anger at the universe and their malformed existence. These undead godling husks were hated by deities who actively tried to hide atropals underneath ancient crypts of long-dead civilizations to banish them to forgotten cemetery planes of existence. In times when atropals were unleashed on the Prime Material plane, they went on furious killing sprees until destroyed or neutralized. Some sages speculated that some of the necromancer kings of old were actually atropals.

An atropal scion was truly one of the most perverse undead creatures willed to unlife by dark gods of death. A piece of an atropal's godly flesh could become a 'godling' itself of diminished power but just as filled with spite and evil, unless destroyed. If given unlife, the atropal scion became an unformed monster, resembling an overgrown dead fetus, sometimes with an umbilical cord still attached. Despite its appearance, an atropal scion was extremely intelligent and powerful. "

Born in 800 DR, he lived a storied life as a heroic adventurer before turning to his dark path in his later years. His death in 916 came at the hands of the harpers as well as an Avatar of Lathander. This was undone through resurrection by his cultists some 336 years later, when he began building an army in the early 1280s from a hidden stronghold in the Desertsmouth Mountains Killed again, this time by an adventuring group of Paladins known as The Twelve, he would resurface nearly 100 years later in Vaasa, this time successful in completing a terrifying ritual known as The DragoRage."

#descr "A beholder, sometimes called a sphere of many eyes or an eye tyrant, was a large aberration normally found in the Underdark. These large, orb-shaped beings had ten eyestalks and one central eye, each containing powerful magic. Powerful and intelligent, beholders were among the greatest threats to the world.

The beholder's eyes were remarkable things. Hard, solid balls that drew in both light through the pupil and magical energy through the iris, which consisted of some sort of translucent crystal. The shape of the iris could be anything the beholder wished, which granted it's owner both darkvision and exceptional vision in the light - beholders in a brightly lit space had been observed as capable of counting the legs on a minuscule insect at distances of over one hundred and twenty feet. Beholder eyes also had up to twelve lenses, all capable of movement and rotation independent of the others, which was what granted them control over the aiming of their eye rays.

Occasionally, a beholder, while sleeping, would warp reality with it's subconscious mind and spawn a fully-grown beholder instantaneously out of nothing right there where it slept. If it was dreaming about itself, it may have created an exact duplicate of itself, otherwise it could spawn a beholder-kin or even a completely unique beholder-like creature.

Beholder minds were divided into two separate entities. Each of these entities thought and acted on its own accord even though it was bound to the same body as the other half of its mind. Neither half of the beholder's mind trusted the other, so they hid a lot from each other, creating a very paranoid relationship."

#descr "The thri-kreen were an insectoid monstrous humanoid race that primarily lived in the Shaar. They were a race of nomads and hunters, also commonly known as mantis warriors. They had superior physical abilities compared to a human, with high strength and great agility. They were faster on their feet, and naturally and supremely good at jumping. They were quick enough to deflect or dodge an incoming projectile. Their carapace was naturally armored, being tough and resistant to impact, and its sandy color helped them hide in sandy or barren landscapes. Thri-kreen typically grew to be skilled in their senses, hiding, jumping, climbing, and balancing.

A thri-kreen's four claws and a bite from its mandibles were dangerous natural weapons. They secreted a paralyzing poison from their mouths, sufficient for a single venomous bite per day. This could hamper a victim's agility, or cause paralysis for several minutes.

Thri-kreen were also naturally psionic beings, possessing psionic energy and knowing innately a number of powers. Including camoflage, direction sense, and others. They could see in the dark through darkvision, and did not sleep at all, making them immune to sleep spells and the like."

Unicorns revered the Place of the Unicorn in the Sword Mountains as a sacred site.

At least 100 unicorns could be found in the High Forest, as well as a few down through the Unicorn Run. Unicorns were most likely to be seen near the Sisters waterfalls, where seeing them and the moon rise above the cliffs were seen as a sign of good fortune from the goddess Mielikki. Other locations home to unicorns included the Forgotten Forest.

They were often sent as servants of Corellon Larethian, Mielikki, Mystra, Silvanus, and Tymora to aid their worshipers."

#descr "An owlbear was a large magical or fey beast that looked like a cross between an owl and a bear. Notoriously aggressive and ferocious, they were among the most feared predators in the wilderness. 

More cunning than an owl, these creatures were incredibly aggressive and obstinate and were famous for their ferocity and foul temper. They would go so far as to attack almost anything that moved — anything larger than a mouse and anything they thought they could kill — on sight and without any provocation. They hunted so heavily because of their insatiable appetites, more than that of a giant owl and a bear combined. A hungry owlbear feared nothing, not even superior strength and size or any other discouragement or obstacle or impediment, and with little instinct for self-preservation, they would fight to the death. Only one that had already fed well was disinclined to attack a superior foe or risk its life. However, an owlbear's ferocity was also its key weakness — they could be easily lured into a trap or tricked into charging off a cliff, if available."

Sometimes described as panther or puma-like, they had six legs and a pair of 5 foot long tentacles sprouting from their shoulders that end in pads of sharp thorny edges. These barbs could punch through steel. Displacer beasts could also bend light, making them appear to be between several feet from their actual position. The same ability made them resistant to all ranged attacks and excellent at hiding.

Lightning fast, they enjoyed killing for sport as much as for a meal, and they nearly always hunted in packs. Their favorite prey were intelligent humanoids, including orcs, goblins, and humans. 

Equally at home in woods, mountains, plains and even the underdark, they are known to inhabit the High Forest, the Yuirwood of Aglarond, Estagund, Durpar, Thar, the Endless Wastes, the Alimir Mountains of Calimshan, the Thunder Peaks, and even the Abyss itself."

#descr "Lantern archons were the souls of those good and lawful who had recently died. Other archons tended to treat lantern archons like children since they were so new to the celestial realms. Worshipers of the gods Tyr, Torm, and Ilmater became lantern archons when they died, though not all lawful good individuals who had followed other gods became lanterns. Lantern archons could also be created by an act of sacrifice from a spellcaster using sanctified magic.

They were rather plentiful in the lawful good Outer Planes, often interacting with plane-traveling adventurers or newly arrived souls, happy to provide whatever assistance they could. They were limited in what help they could offer, however, since they did not have corporeal bodies, so their help was usually advice, guidance, or inspiration, often in the form of riddles or parables.

In the view of some scholars, lantern archons were not true archons but only ''proto-archons'', from which all other archons were ultimately derived. A lantern archon that had proven itself ready for the next station of goodness was transformed into a hound archon, represented by reaching 24 xp. Only 5 nations may call on archons: Waterdeep, Cormyr, Halruaa, Impiltur, and Silverymoon due to their associations with the Gods of the Triad and their traditionnaly aggressive stance against evil."

#descr "Hound archons were the guardians of the first and second layers of Celestia. While typically associated with the gods of the House of the Triad, they sometimes served other gods of lawful and good alignments so long as they could fight against evil in all its supernal forms. They were one of the most common archons summoned to the Material Plane, and their duties sometimes took them to other planes as well.

When one looked upon a hound archon, he or she sensed a feeling of simultaneous peacefulness and readiness for action. Hounds were intelligent and very protective, seeking to defend the innocent and helpless against the dark forces of the multiverse. Despite their combat skill, like all archons, hounds preferred not to fight if at all possible, and would usually only be driven to combat if protecting themselves, their plane, or their lantern archons or others who are unable to defend themselves. Like all archons, a hound's ultimate goal was to ascend to higher state of goodness and eventually become one with the plane. In the meantime, they served as proxies of the deific powers. 

They could not only see invisible and shapeshifting beings for who and what they really were, they could also teleport at will and call on the divine aid of their patron deity.

Hound Archons are transformed into Warden Archons when they achieve 151 XP, through either time or combat. Only 5 nations may call on archons: Waterdeep, Cormyr, Halruaa, Impiltur, and Silverymoon due to their associations with the Gods of the Triad and their traditionnaly aggressive stance against evil."

Their duties also extended to scrying on the material plane and other dimensions, ever vigilant against approaching threats and keeping their eyes on the imperiled faithful. Powerful summoners could call on warden archons for extraplanar aid, and Warden Archons could teleport anywhere that they wanted without a chance of failure.

10 feet tall and resembling bears bathed in righteous light, they were resistant to many magical spells, immune to electricity, and could not be affected by mundane weapons. Like other archons, when engaged in battle, a warden archon produced a menacing aura that negatively affected its foes' ability to fight against it. 

When a warden archon finally gains their platinum accoutrements - at 300 xp - he or she will be transformed into a sword archon. Only 5 nations may call on archons: Waterdeep, Cormyr, Halruaa, Impiltur, and Silverymoon due to their associations with the Gods of the Triad and their traditionnaly aggressive stance against evil."

They also served as the enforcers of the laws of the Celestial Hebdomad. Only the most powerful of summoners could call on sword archons for extraplanar aid.

Unlike other archons, swords enjoyed battle, but they did not allow this enjoyment to cause them to violate their oaths and would only fight against truly evil foes. They would never strike at a weak or defenseless enemy or one who surrendered - not that Dominions 5 will enforce this, by the way. Head canon as you see fit. 

Their twin, holy flaming longswords were extensions of their arms. A sword archon's most powerful attack, however, was its discorporating dive attack, which, if successful, utterly destroyed the victim's body and sent his or her soul directly to a prison somewhere on Mount Celestia. They only used such a powerful attack against beings who had severely transgressed against the laws of Celestia or who were sworn enemies of the lawful good deities that they served.

While a host of Throne or Tome Archons could be fun, this is the end of the line for XP Progression. Higher Archons just dont leave Celestia. Only 5 nations may call on archons: Waterdeep, Cormyr, Halruaa, Impiltur, and Silverymoon due to their associations with the Gods of the Triad and their traditionnaly aggressive stance against evil."

As constructs, golems were innately immune to a number of attacks; among these were mind-altering, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease and death effects as well as most spells. They never tired, got confused or distracted and possessed both low-light and darkvision. Because they were mindless, golems lacked much in the way of creativity and initiative.

They were also extremely effective in sieges, both offensively and defensively."

A significant population of them migrated to Faerun via portals to the Firelands and the Peaks of Flame in Chult.  Their skin was so hot that even the merest touch caused burns. Salamanders also had a vibrant culture of metalsmithing crafting weapons utilizing the power of flame. 

One of the largest incursions of Salamanders into Faerun occured in Thay prior to the Time of Troubles. Known as the Salamander War, Thayan Zulkirs summoned large numbers of Salamanders as a means of waging a war against their enemies on the Sea of Fallen Stars. However, their effort to banish the Salamanders at the conclusion was unsuccessful and the resulting conflict nearly destroyed the Priador.

Salamander Nobles are the lords of their kind - organized, disciplined, and capable of powerful feats of fire magic. They make formidable foes. They also have a significant chance of escaping their bindings and becoming independent."

Otyughs could occasionally be found in the sewers of Waterdeep and were naturalized in the Surmarsh of Thay. Underground societies often dumped their garbage and waste in Otyugh lairs, and the creatures took this as offerings and would, at least most of the time, not attack them.

Because of their abberant minds, control of these creatures requires an ability to lead magical creatures."

#descr "The purple worm was a monstrous subterranean creature akin to an enormous and bizarre earthworm. When attacking, a purple worm coiled into a mass 20 feet wide from which head and tail lunged to bite, grab, and sting anything within a range. With its mouth, it could catch and swallow beings whole with ease; those swallowed were crushed and dissolved by stomach acids if they could not escape by cutting their way or using magic. The tail stinger inflicted a potent, debilitating venom.

They were highly skilled swimmers and possessed a tremorsense that let them sense everything in contact with the ground.

They lived underground, at least until they erupted from the earth to attack. They were capable of chewing through solid rock as they hunted prey, and thus made many of the tunnels in the Underdark. Fortunately, they rarely returned to these tunnels, making them useful passages. Purple worms were naturally a menace to the denizens of the Underdark, and drow, duergar, and illithids all maintained magical wards against them."

The Netherese used them to remotely power vast quantities of quasi-magical items enjoyed by the common folk of the empire for everything from light sources to remote viewing devices. The most dramatic use of the mythellars, however, was to establish an Enclave - first cutting off the top of a mountain, then flipping it over and floating it through the air so they could build their citadels on the flat surface.

From these mile-sized floating fortresses, the Netherese ruled their ancient world. The vast quantities of free-emenating raw magic, however, drew a species of magical creature that fed upon these energies - the Phaerimm. The resulting clashes between the Phaerimm and the Netherese brought about cataclysm. Establish your enclaves at your own risk."

#descr "Rakshasas were a dignified race of duplicitous outsiders that mostly dwelt on the Material Plane. They were reviled as devious sorcerers, political puppeteers and thought to be an embodiment of evil.

They combined the habits of a predatory aristocrat with those of an indolent cat, savoring the finest art, music, literature, clothing, weapons and armor while spending large amounts of time lazily resting in their comforts and prowling unseen. Powerful magic, lost spells, arcane tomes and secret lore, particularly those of the evil variety, were of special interest to the born sorcerers. Slaves were collected the same as any other form of art, and were expected to indulge every whim of their cruel master. This served to bolster the already overinflated ego of the rakshasa, a haughtiness they displayed to all who knew their true identity.

Upon reaching independence, rakshasa usually attempted to establish their own territories as far away from any other rakshasas as possible, utilizing their mastery of disguise to carefully investigate a region for years while staying insignificant. They instinctually sought out hideaways, safe houses and secret lairs from which to conduct their schemes and display their opulence, their lives often shifting between periods of hedonistic pleasure and unyielding discipline. Thieves' guilds, mercenary companies, business fronts or temples to neutral deities were suitable covers and if no such thing could be found, the rakshasa would be forced to create one itself."

#name "Infernal Dire horse"
#descr "Dire horse were bigger and wilder relatives of normal horses notable for their aggression and sheer strength. The bests appear as huge versions of normal wild horses with wild unkempt manes and bone plates growing out of the sides of their heads. Their hooves had deadly jagged edges. They could be found solitarily and in herds of six and up to thirty beasts. Being completely wild animals, dire horses were extremely hard to domesticate or tame due to their aggressive bestial nature.

Dire horses were known to inhabit the lands of Shaar, Murghôm, and Semphar. Their fierce nature and fearsome power led to several cults sprouting to worship the creatures, as well as numerous legends. In one, Yeenoghu, the Demon Prince of Gnolls, can be found riding a team of dire horses in the heart of dust-storms along the Shaar.

Infernal Dire horse have magical hooves and can blind enemies within close range due to the flying dust, reprented in Dom5 by the awe ability."

#descr "Vampires were a type of undead that fed on blood. They were one of the most feared and powerful undead creatures. A vampire retained all the abilities it had in life, and it gained the ability to drain blood and life energy, and to dominate other creatures with its gaze. All vampires were evil, even if they had not been during their mortality. 

Among their weaknesses, vampires were eternally bound to their coffins and the unholy earth where they were buried. This is represented in Dom5 by the homesick trait as well as being immortal only within friendly dominion. In addition, vampires only ever operate at night, and so darkness is cast at the start of every battle with a vampiress."

#descr "Among the most legendary vampires in all the Realms, Strahd von Zarovich forged a pact with the Dark Powers of the Shadowfell in order to achieve immortality and take his brother Sergei's wife Tatyana, with whom he had fallen madly in love. That love proved unrequited, and Tatyana flung herself from a cliff in fear, anger, and sorrow. Now cursed with vampirism and forever alone, Barovia was transported into the Shadowfell and became a prison from which Strahd could never escape. Over time, Strahd became the realm itself, telepathically aware of all that happened within Barovia.

By summoning Strahd, you are essentially merging the entire province in which the spell is cast with the Shadowfell realm of Barovia. Over time, Strahd will drain the province of population, but also bring enormous wealth in death gems to your nation. While now somewhat freed of his bonds, Strahd remains spiritually linked to his summoned province and will lose one-third of his health each turn he spends away from his home. Strahd's immortality will always return him to this province, but if the province is lost, Barovia will soon be transported back to the Shadowfell and Strahd will need to be resummoned. Note also that Strahd is unique. Resummoning him while he is part of your nation will not result in having a clone. Other nations can also summon him, resulting in losing your original summon."

#descr "Drizzt Do'Urden was a male drow ranger, atypical of his dark-elven kind - he had forsaken both the evil ways of his people and their home in the Underdark and became a legendary hero of the North. His agility and fighting prowess were legendary, and many described his movements as too fast to follow with the eye. After Drizzt studied under Masoj Hun'ett for six months in Sorcere, Masoj acknowledged that if Drizzt had chosen to become a wizard, he would have become quite a powerful one indeed.

Thoughtful and sensitive to others, Drizzt held himself to the highest ideals but didn't expect the same of others. He yearned to be accepted, but was haunted by the danger he brought to those he befriended. He had many foes, including the clerics of Lolth and the demon Errtu. He also had a legendary rivalry with the human assassin Artemis Entreri. 

As part of leaving the intolerance of the drow behind him, he also abandoned the drow faith in Llolth following the sacrificial death of his father for Drizzt's refusal to murder an elven child during a surface raid. He found cause in Mielikki, goddess of rangers, and carried her symbol, the white unicorn, around his neck. 

He came into possession of many artifacts during his membership and adventures with the Companions of the Hall. You'll need to forge or find some of them on your own. At game start, he carries with him his figurine of wonderous power, which summons his black panther companion, Guenhwyvar as well as Mooshie's Longbow, given him by his first surface friend and mentor, Montolio Debrouchee."

#descr "Tiamat was the lawful evil dragon goddess of greed, queen of evil dragons and, for a time, reluctant servant of the greater gods Bane and later Asmodeus. Before entering the Faerûnian pantheon, she was a member of the Draconic pantheon, and for some time she was also a member of the Untheric pantheon.

Tiamat was a unique chromatic dragon, who had one head for each primary color of the most common species of chromatics (black, blue, green, red, white). Each head was able to operate entirely independently of each other and had the powers of a member of the respective race of dragonkind. Her body also had traits in common with a wyvern, including a long tail tipped with a venomous stinger.

She also often manifested as one of her avatars, her favorite of which was The Dark Lady - a mulan woman with long black hair and completely black eyes. She always wore dark robes and frequently had a seductive smile on her face.

Tiamat wanted to take control of the Realms, and even as she was thwarted again and again by her enemies, she didn't give up. She had a particular interest in controlling Unther, Chessenta, and Murghom. She frequently made unwitting puppets out of members of the Cult of the Dragon and though she had a loyal cult of her own, rarely paid them much attention. Her clergy was regimented by a strict hierarchy of ranks and titles. Her clerics were occupied by the twin tasks of acquiring an ever-increasing hoard of wealth for the faith and sabotaging the faiths of other deities. As a result, they occupied most of their time with an unending series of thefts, assassinations, acts of vandalism, and arson. In Unther and Chessenta they were primarily concerned with seizing as much power as possible, while in western Faerun, the cult's agents were focused on subverting the Cult of the Dragon."

She is the most beloved deity in Unther, but her priesthood has little power. Based in Shussel, the site of their major temple, they are caught between the needs of their faithful and their legal subservience to the increasingly unpopular Gilgeam. He has recently decreed that neither she nor Ramman may train worshipers to learn priest spells of 6th level or higher. The priesthood of Ishtar is thus quite upset and is considering giving support to the growing rebellion against Gilgeam and working to establish a new order within the Untheric pantheon."

#name "Erinye"
#descr "Erinyes are fierce baatezu whose heavenly appearance belies their wicked intentions. They are the furies of the Nine Hells, responsible for bringing infernal justice and vengeful retribution to mortals and devils alike. Erinyes were not only physically stunning, but dangerously capable, highly disciplined and unfailingly loyal to their lords. When hunting mortal souls they showed both ruthlessness and cunning, exploiting their angelic appearance and tempting those they came across into committing wicked acts. Erinyes, while not the greatest warriors of Hell, possessed legendary combat prowess. They are armed with magical poisoned swords and bows. Erniyes had powerful charming abilities causing those they looked upon to obey their every whim. Conversely, an erinyes could strike terror into anyone that looked upon them, causing them flee in panic."

#descr "Osyluths, also known as bone devils, are the taskmasters and interrogators of the baatezu devils, acting as law-enforcement throughout the Nine Hells. The very presence of the skeletal sleuths inspires dread due to their love of inflicting physical and mental suffering, on both mortals and devils alike. The osyluths have power over all others of their race (excepting only the pit fiends). In essence, osyluths are the guardians of baatezu morality and caste. They watch to make sure the ideals of law and evil are upheld by every member of the race. Their tails inject a potent, strength-sapping poison into their victims, quickly rendering most powerless. They can gate 4d6 Nupperibos at the beginning of combat."

Males often have thin, ragged mustaches. The animal form of a wererat was that of a dire rat two feet long from nose to rump. In hybrid form, the wererat was shorter than in its human form and its head, torso and tail were those of a rat while its limbs were a little more humanoid in appearance. Wererats recognized their relative weakness and congregated in numbers in the sewer systems beneath surface cities. Not only did those who live on the surface maintain their lairs for them but they unknowingly protected the wererat lairs with their fortifications, allowing the wererats to frequently leave their defenses lacking. While not as strong as other lycanthropes (being roughly as strong as humans), Wererats were nimble, intelligent, cunning, and adept at surprise attacks. Only silver, magical weapons, or poison ivy could harm them.

Wererats shared the animal instinctiveness of all lycanthropes and were markedly more dexterous than humans as well as a little more hardy. Any damage caused by a weapon not made of silver or coated in alchemical silver would be reduced. Wererats were often carriers of filth fever due to the environments that they lived in."

Savage fighters, sahuagin asked for and gave no quarter; not even to children or babies. They had wide and powerful jaws filled with long, sharp fangs, which they often used in battle. When swimming, a sahuagin tore with its feet or hands, striking with its talons or a weapon. Especially when in groups, they rode mantas as a means of transport to assault ships and other vessels. They also used sharks as allies in battle. 

Although they excelled in physical prowess, they greatly feared magic, so they never tried developing or studying it for any purpose. Divine magic was tolerated only as a necessary evil."

Each baron ruled over a village, while a prince would dominate twenty villages and a king would govern an entire coastline. Kings would administer cities of several thousands inhabitants, and their palace were always much bigger than any of the other buildings in the area.

Having been enslaved by nearly every race of the Sea of Fallen Stars, especially by the kuo-toa and ixitxachitl, most today live free in more shallow, coastal waters as nomads.

Most locathah live in communal tribes. Those of 100 members or less are usually simple hunting parties, dominated by males, but in larger tribes, they prefer a matriarchal chieftain. The chieftain lays a multitude of eggs that are cared for by the rest of the tribe. Kelp farms and hunting territory are defended zealously and religious ceremonies to their creator-god Eadro are kept totally private, but otherwise, locathah are welcoming of strangers."

Either way, the diligence of Blibdoolpoolp's whips made her the dominant deity among all other kuo-toa and the focus of the kuo-toas' lives. She even created her own Chosen out of gifted whips and monitors, monsters known as kuo-toa leviathans.

Blibdoolpoolp's priests conducted constant sacrifices in her name in ceremonial drowning pools, usually choosing of captives and slaves, although kuo-toa perceived to be mad or defiant could also be sacrificed. The duties of the archpriests involved communication with outsiders, judging criminals, conducted rituals during breeding seasons, and the growth and culling of fingerlings."

Cloakers preferred not to travel long distances and were generally reclusive, however some were known to coerce small groups of humans, goblins and drow into doing their bidding, with derro and quaggoths being the most common such servants.

- Society -
Though they were dangerous hunters, quaggoths were just as often prey for other predators of the Underdark, particularly those like the drow or illithid with magic at their disposal. About half of all quaggoths lived in slavery. Quaggoths could be trained as servants and guards if captured young. Drow sometimes enslaved them as guards and spider handlers, while illithids used them as expendable soldiers. 

- History -
The origin of the quaggoths was unknown. Some believed they were once a surface-dwelling race driven underground, while others claimed they had been bred by drow magicians as a slave race before escaping to fill their own niche in the Underdark. Some sages claim that they were once a semi-civilized race that dominated much of the Underdark through conquest and ritual sacrifice, until the drow, duergar, and other races broke their power. They did, however, have an underground kingdom called Ursadunthar, deep beneath the Spine of the World, until it fell to duergar from Gracklstugh in the −1350 DR in the Deepbear Battles.

By the 14th century DR, a population of quaggoths, orcs, and half-breeds (called boogins) had arisen in the Underdark beneath the Trollmoors. They referred to themselves as the 'spider killers' in recognition of their constant struggle to resist drow incursions."

Umber hulks were commonly viewed by other races as unthinking brutes. This was a misconception they were perfectly happy to propagate. Whilst not particularly intelligent, umber hulks were perfectly capable of rational thought and forward planning. Umber hulks normally had no need for complex plans, magic, numbers, or technology to accomplish their goals and so did not employ such things. If a situation warranted more than sheer force, they were intelligent enough to use their earth-shaping abilities to out-think an enemy.

Umber hulks were solitary, not due to a hatred of one another but simply because working together had no perceivable benefit, as they could handle most threats individually. They preferred to stay underground, as there was no use in going above ground, and they disliked the light."

Hook horrors liked to live as families of around a dozen members. They remained subterranean all their lives.  They slept around half of the time, moving sluggishly when not under threat, meaning that they could survive on relatively little food for their size. They were an omnivorous species, and though they preferred meat, they would resort to fungi or lichens if they could not obtain it. It was rumored that they particularly enjoyed eating drow.

Only when they were desperately hungry would hook horrors turn to foods such as phycomids, shriekers, violet fungi, and zygoms to stay alive. Although such food was poisonous to most humanoids, hook horrors were basically immune and some believed these were part of their diet in order to mitigate their unfortunate susceptibility to parasites and disease."

In addition to using various conjurations to protect their cities, having demonic slaves was a sign of prestige for the drow that demonstrated the master's power and intimidated their enemies. "

One of their usual tasks was to terrorize merchants who took Vhaeraun as their patron, as well as settlements run by the followers of Vhaeraun or Ghaunadaur."

#descr "The Militant Myrlochar, sometimes known as the Order of Soul Spiders, was an elite fighting organization composed exclusively of male crusaders, and found in the dark elven cities where Lolth was worshiped and males were allowed entrance into her priesthood. They directly served the reigning Matron Mothers of the city and were employed to kill their targets. They were usually used without pause until they got killed.

- Dark Elves - 
Drow, also known as dark elves, were a sub-race of elves that predominantly lived in the Underdark. They were hated and feared due to their cruelty, though some non-evil and an even smaller number of good drow existed.

The moral code of the average drow was informed by the teachings of Lolth. From birth, the drow were taught that they were superior to other races, and as such they believed themselves to be the ultimate beings. This mindset created an arrogance so strong that drow could be incapable of viewing other creatures as their equals, including members of their own kind; almost every drow believed themselves to be the epitome of their superior species. The treatment reserved for non-drow ran the entire gamut from pets, to slaves, to grudgingly respected partners if they proved themselves a military match for them, though never equals. As one might expect, this atmosphere of utter condescension meant that most drow generally felt entitled to do whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted to do it."

#descr "The head of a dark-elf noble House was a matron mother, a powerful priestess of Lolth. Below her, in descending order of influence, were the female members of the House, who were also priestesses. After them came male officers, including the matron's consort. Females had absolute power within their household, and owned all the governmental and militaristic power within the city, although they held no authority until after puberty. Males never held any authority unless they managed to become an officer. In most cases, a matron only lost her position if murdered by her eldest daughter. This usually marked a new direction for the House, and sometimes even its destruction, because the murder of a matron was seen as a sign of disfavor from Lolth.

Drow cities were ruled by their aristocracy, the drow Houses, made up by the families that had the strength and incredible influence to occupy the best lands, with most Houses often being located in close proximity to each other. While the nobles hoarded the best territory and resources, the rest of the population was forced to fend for themselves. These priestesses of Lolth that normally reigned over drow societies were poor rulers who tossed their cities into a haphazard organization."

#descr "Known as the Queen of Spiders as well as the Queen of the Demonweb Pits, Llolth was the most influential goddess of the drow, within the pantheon of the Dark Seldarine.

Lolth was a goddess of cold cruelty not out of place in the darkest depths of the endless Abyss, reveling in betrayal and bloodshed and toying with everyone from her minions to her victims. She not only enjoyed, but thrived upon torture, destruction, and death, whether personally performing it or causing it. Every interaction was ultimately done with malice, ill will seething from her every move, and even those who knew her well could be surprised by just how deep her viciousness went. Her malevolence could be compared to the rage of the brutal orc deity Gruumsh, but where his fury was as mindlessly violent as a force of nature, her malice was complicated and deliberate. Furthermore, Gruumsh could at least be said to be steady and constant in his hate, whilst Lolth's was utterly capricious.

Lolth demanded absolute fealty and obedience from all drow, and questioning her motives or wisdom was considered a sin. This applied even to male drow despite her considering them to be unclean, and she took vengeful notice if one abandoned her faith. She also secretly desired the worship of other types of elves, as well as humans, and enjoyed corrupting them into her service even more than torment and devastation. In contrast, she fomented unending chaos amongst the drow, eternally setting them against each other. Ostensibly this was to weed out the weak and complacent, leaving only the strongest, cruelest, and most devious to serve her, and to some degree she believed this, but it was also simply for her own amusement and supremacy."

She was the patroness and protector of the few dark elves who longed to return to the surface and live there, at peace with other races, and to abandon the endless conflicts and intrigues that dominated the lives of most drow. 

Specialized clerics of the Dark Maiden were known as Sword Dancers. They were excellent dancers and spellsingers, known to use an agile and acrobatic fencing style resembling a dance. The sword dancers led missions to find, assist, and protect any drow looking to return to the surface (or that could be made to return) and embrace a different life. They were skilled diplomats, especially active near the settlements of elves and other races, working to establish peace and cooperation between drow and surface dwellers.

The main work of the church of Eilistraee was reaching drow trapped in Lolth's web, aiding them, and providing them with a new life and future on the surface. The followers of the Dark Maiden also strove to offer kindness, help, and protection to those in need and they nurtured beauty and arts, spreading joy whenever and wherever possible and showing that the drow could create, rather than merely destroy."

#descr "Driders were drow that had been transformed from the waist down so they had the body of a spider. The transformation was typically a punishment for failing a test of Lolth. Their creation was an agonizing process. They grew physically stronger and kept all magical and other abilities and skills they learned during their lives.

Only drow could be turned into driders. When a Lolthite drow reached a certain level of power, that drow underwent the Test of Lolth administered by Lolth herself. Those who fail this test but survive were turned into driders by the Spider Queen.

The second category of drider origins were drow mages. Part of the duties of Lolth's clergy was to ensure that their idea of society was kept free of dissidents and mages were put under general suspicion. Once a mage reached a certain level of power, they were abducted and then subjected to a test of loyalty called the Test. Failures were turned by a Lolthite priestess into a drider with a ritual that channeled magical energies directly from Lolth herself.

The third category of driders came about when Lolth summoned a drow she considered promising to the Demonweb Pits. They were subjected to a test by the Spider Queen and when they failed, they were turned into driders and sent back. Few are known to have passed this test.

Despite the cultural shunning of driders some drow wizards and sorcerers developed a spell to turn temporarily into a drider, called dridershape.

Llolth created all driders sexless because she did not want to have a race of capable enemies to the drow. "

She was the patroness and protector of the few dark elves who longed to return to the surface and live there, at peace with other races, and to abandon the endless conflicts and intrigues that dominated the lives of most drow.

She was the daughter of Araushnee (later Lolth) and Corellon Larethian, a free-spirited and kind-hearted goddess, with a fiery streak in her personality. When, during her youth, a host of evil deities assaulted Arvandor (her home), Araushnee's treachery almost made her slay her own father. Even though she was cleared from any guilt, Eilistraee chose to share her mother's exile, because she knew that the drow would need her light in the times to come. After the descent of the drow, Eilistraee tried to be a mother goddess to her people and bring them the hope of a new life. She fought to lead them back to the lands of light, helping them to flourish and prosper in harmony with other races, free from Lolth's tyranny and the conflicts that dominated their lives. 

Hers was an uphill battle, however, as her power was little and she was opposed by all the gods of the Dark Seldarine. But, despite having to overcome many hardships and setbacks, Eilistraee never gave up fighting for her people. In the 1370s DR, her conflict with her mother over the souls of the drow race ultimately led to Eilistraee's defeat and disappearance."

This empire would fall in -34,100 DR after a century of civil strife that drove many sarrukh to the planes.

They created many races, including nagas, troglodytes, the Yuan-ti, and many others lost to time. The Sarrukh were the first to battle with the dreaded Phaerimm, driving them to the Underdark beneath Anauroch, but the effort cost them their empire. They were also the creators of the Nether Scrolls, which they called the Golden Skins of the World Serpent.

In the years that followed the collapse of their last empire, sometime around -350 DR, they entered a period of long hibernation, their last known location being beneath the Serpent Deeps in the Mhair jungles of Chult. Rumors of awakened Sarrukh began appearing around 1372 DR, with much consternation by sages who feared their return."

Merrshaulk was one of the divine fragments that split off from the World Serpent. As the World Serpent ceased being actively worshiped by scalykind in favor of its aspects during the Days of Thunder, around -35,000 DR, it was primarily the yuan-ti who took up the worship of Merrshaulk. 

Merrshaulk eventually entered a period of somnolence and failed to consistently answer the prayers of his priests. He was eventually reawakened by the sarrukh emperor Pil'it'ith. Merrshaulk thanked Pil'it'ith for his service to scalykind and directed him to create a new sarrukh homeland, promising to once more watch over the sarrukh and making Pil'it'ith his Chosen."

#name "Dwarven Cave Stalker"
#descr "Most dwarven strongholds are made up of numerous tunnels, warrens, and cave systems, some of which have been ignored or forgotten by their owners. Monstrous creatures and humanoids, like orcs, goblins, and ogres expand like fungus in these cold, dark areas, using them as staging grounds to attack the heart of dwarven communities. To prevent this from happening, certain dwarves are trained from an early age to navigate the long-forgotten tunnels and make preemptive strikes against their enemies. These stealthy warriors are known as cave stalkers.

Cave stalkers specialize in hunting down and eliminating creatures in the dark, twisting caves around dwarven communities. They use stealth, ambush, and deception to single out foes and remove them one by one. A typical strategy is to track down the enemy, then meld into stone close to their location. The cave stalker then waits for her enemy to pass by, leaping out from behind to attack when the target least expects it. A cave stalker also uses her finely tuned stonecunning ability to find the best areas to create pits, cave-ins, and rockslides, often eliminating the enemy without drawing her axe. If a cave stalker is outnumbered, she retreats into the darkness, hiding until she can pick off individual targets.

Because they spend so much time in the stark wilderness of caves and caverns, cave stalkers are slightly ostracized by the rest of the clan. The typical dwarf shudders at the thought of leaving behind her clan, traditions, and forge, so the rootless existence of the cave stalker seems like a social aberration. Still, there is great honor to be found in protecting the clan from attack, so they are given some respect. None of this concerns the cave stalker, who cares little for what others think; she finds purpose in what she does every time she brings down another one of her enemies. She prefers to work alone, but also knows that cooperation with others has its advantages."

These legendary heroes used the power of the earth to enhance their combat style. A deepstone sentinel immerses himself in these ancient teachings to link himself to the power of stone. Most deepstone sentinels use this power in the defense of their fellow dwarves, though some take a more active approach battling the enemies of their people. In combat, a deepstone sentinel is a living mountain, a stony redoubt that provides shelter to his allies while crashing like an avalanche upon his enemies. The ground shifts and churns under his feet. One moment he stands atop a small, earthen mound that blocks his enemies - the next he summons an earthquake to knock his foes to the ground.

Berronar was a kind and caring godess with strong maternal love for all dwarves (and even dwarven allies) who valued compassion, tradition, fidelity, and family. With a merry disposition and hearty laugh constantly at the ready, Berronar's skills of persuasion were such that she could usually bring two foes to understand one another and set aside their differences. The Revered Mother was gentle in speech and ever-forgiving of her children, divine or otherwise.

At the same time, the indomitable Mother Goddess never wavered or despaired in the face of adversity or loss. She could be strict and even fierce when the situation warranted, and would go to almost any extreme to protect the dwarves.

In the rigid church structure, every cleric knew their place, and every clan's church was built to look alike. This was done so visitors from other clans knew exactly where they fit in. Berronar's clerics were known as faenor, which translated as 'those of the home'. Faenor served as the guardians and protectors of dwarven clans. They archived the lore, traditions, and family histories of the dwarves. By acting as teachers and healers, they aimed to further the good health and good character of the dwarven race. Serving as the moral compass of the dwarves, they could be very conservative and they did not tolerate foolhardiness and controversial ideas in young dwarves."

#descr "Moradin was the lawful good god of the dwarves and the chief deity in their pantheon. The Soul Forger was strength incarnate and force of will embodied, a harsh but fair judge who evaluated his creations by the goodness of their works first and intentions second. The Dwarffather inspired dwarven inventions and constantly sought to improve their race, encouraging a good-natured, intelligent, and harmonious existence with other good races while battling their pride and isolationist tendencies.

Moradin preferred to work through manifestations rather than avatars, believing that dwarves had to work for their own place and salvation in the world, and so he seldom appeared in the Realms. When he did, it was only to help dwarves against a numerically overpowering force, and he might bestow blessings to favored warriors prior to the battle such as strength spells.

Usually any intervention from Moradin served the purpose of guiding his people to the best decisions in times of crisis, but he also did so to aid those that might be of help to the dwarves as a whole. This took the form of either inspiring dwarves who would serve their kin in the future or encouraging non-dwarves to provide assistance to his people.

Moradin's clerics, known as Sonnlinor, were usually drawn from family lines, like most dwarven occupations; they wore earthy colors, with chain mail and silvered helms. Moradin charged his followers with the task of wiping out the kingdoms of orcs and wiping out the followers of Gruumsh. The church of Moradin had an active role in guiding the morals of dwarven communities; they emphasized his hand in everyday dwarven activities such as mining, smithing, and engineering, and invoked his blessing when these tasks began. They led the push to found new dwarven kingdoms and increase their status among surface communities."

He was the dwarven adoptive father of Catti-brie and Wulfgar, friend to Drizzt Do'Urden and Regis, crafter of Aegis-fang, and a member of the Companions of the Hall. 

Bruenor was gruff and stubborn, but he showed a tender side for his daughter, Catti-brie, and even Wulfgar at times. He was somewhat suspicious of magic. He was willing to put aside his prejudices for other races when needed, which helped him gain the friendship of Drizzt. He was a strong leader and equally strong fighter. His legacy of leadership still persisted decades after his death.

In the 1100s DR, when Bruenor was just a boy, his people were run out of Mithral Hall by the shadow dragon Shimmergloom and his duergar minions.

Bruenor's clan took up residence in Icewind Dale under Kelvin's Cairn, close to the Ten-Towns. Clan Battlehammer supplied the towns with well-made dwarven weapons and armor. When Bruenor came of age, he took his rightful place as leader of the clan. For all of his adult life, Bruenor dreamed of returning to Mithral Hall to reclaim his homeland.

But it was only after many adventures with his companions, from Frozenfar to Luskan, to the High Forest and Savage Frontier, and finally to the Silver Marches, that they would have the resources to stake their claim.

Wulfgar was born in 1339 DR to the Tribe of the Elk in Icewind Dale, the coldest and northernmost city of Faerun. In his boyhood, he was the flag bearer for Heafstaag, King of the Elk Tribe. In a battle between the tribe and the Ten Towns, Bruenor Battlehammer, leading his dwarven contingent, knocked out Wulfgar with a blow to the head. After the battle, when the people of Ten Towns were slitting the throats of the surviving barbarians, Bruenor spared Wulfgar. Instead of death, he sentenced him to five years and a day of service to Bruenor. Wulfgar took to the forge and, in time, changed his opinion of Bruenor from slaver to father. Bruenor crafted Aegis-fang with Wulfgar in mind. When Wulfgar's sentence was almost up, Bruenor bade Drizzt Do'Urden the drow to teach Wulfgar how to fight. When the dark wizard, Akar Kessel, came to conquer the Ten Towns, Wulfgar defeated the white dragon Ingeloakastimizilian, known as Icingdeath, turned the tide of the conflict, and claimed leadership of the tribes. 

He would go on to many adventures as a key member of the Companions of the Hall, and aided Breunor in reclaiming his birthright.

Wulfgar wielded Aegis-Fang, a weapon he and Breunor crafted together. Made of mithril and adamantite, coated in diamond magically adhered to the weapon, and engraved with inscriptions and symbols of the dwarven gods Dumathoin, Moradin, and Clangeddin Silverbeard, Aegis-fang was a remarkable weapon. Specifically attuned to Wulfgar, it would magically return to his hands upon his telepathic command."

The name means Shadow in the high elven language, so named by the item's first owner, the Bladesinger Josidiah Starym of Myth Drannor in the year 253 DR. An error in the crafting led to a brief rift in which the panther was not enslaved to the item but rather became a permanent spiritual resident of the astral sea and the item summoned the spirit of Guenhwyvar instead of transforming into her, as intended. This meant that Guenhwyvar would live free in the Astral Sea, untouched by time, and her wounds received on the physical plane, though causing pain and weakness, would not lead to her death. 

At some point during his travels in the Underdark, Josidiah lost the onyx figurine and it eventually passed through many hands, eventually finding its way to Menzoberranzan and finally into the hands of Drizzt during his apprenticeship to the wizard Masoj Hun'ett. The two trained and worked together on patrols, building a bond of friendship. 

In 1328, Masoj ordered Guenhwyvar to kill his apprentice, but the panther's bond with the young drow allowed her to resist the order and she instead aided Drizzt to defeat Masoj and flee Menzoberranzan. 

'Forever would Guenhwyvar remember the renegade dark elf, whose heart was so strong and so good and whose loyalty was no less than the panther's own.' — R.A. Salvatore, Siege of Darkness"

Drizzt defeated the bounty hunter, rescuing the young girl, and these events were pivotal in persuading Breunor that the drow was not like his kin.

Trained as a fighter, like her adopted father, her leg was badly injured during an assault and clerics found the wound too difficult to fully heal. She explored training as a wizard as a means to keep up with the Companions, finding she had remarkable instincts for the arcane.

Her personality changed drastically after her rebirth as an infant and upbringing in a far-away land. She reunited with her former friends roughly a hundred years after they first met."

Barely 3 feet tall, and with quite the belly on him. Stereotypically enjoying the comforts, as befits his people, he was subtle, crafty, and never cruel. 

He was born in Calimport and spent his childhood as a street urchin, eventually falling in the notorious criminal mastermind, Pasha Pook. His sticky fingers got him into trouble with the Pookster, and he had to flee the city as far as he could go. Regardless, Pasha Pook's gangsters followed him, even to the far icy ends of the known world - Icewind Dale. 

He became the council spokesperson for Lonelywood, one of the Ten Towns. He befriended Breunor Battlehammer and Drizzt Do'Urden, joining them reluctantly in their excapades, of course, including the quest to clear and restore Mithril Hall. He became chief advisor to Breunor and sometimes led the city in his friend's absence. He would go on to help lead the people of Luskan in revolt against their terrible despotic masters at the Host Tower of the Arcane. He joined Catti-brie in becoming one of Mielikki's chosen following the events of the Spellplague and enjoyed reincarnation as a half-genasi named Spider Parrafin, eventually reuniting with his hold friends nearly roughly 100 years after his death.

Rarely intent to enter battle on his own, Regis was a masterful spy and agent of chaos."

#descr "Crenshinibon had the ability to create an enormous crystalline tower, known as Cryshal-Tirith (meaning 'crystal tower' in Elven) - an exact image of Crenshinibon itself, only now of mammoth proportions. The tower absorbed the sun's light, giving it more strength during the daytime. The Cryshal-Tirith was nearly impervious - it absorbed attacks against its mirrored walls and reflected them back on their source. The only vulnerable part of the tower was its heart, a pulsating crystal that became hidden away within. The tower's door was invisible and undetectable to any beings inherent to the present plane the tower rested upon.

The Shard's primary attack was on the ego, collecting slaves with promises of greatness and riches. It had little hold on paladins and goodly priests, on righteous kings and noble peasants, but one who desired more and was not above deception and destruction to further their ends would inevitably sink into Crenshinibon's grasp."

#descr "Intellect devourers were psionic aberrations that took the form of walking brains. They were servants of the mind flayers and were one of the most dreaded threats of the Underdark, with their power to consume intelligence and possess host bodies. They looked like little more than disembodied large humanoid brains that could walk on a set of four bestial double-jointed bony legs with feet bearing three stubby talons, roughly the size of a dog, though they could compress themselves into a smaller shape in order to enter a host body.  They could move and attack with shocking speed. Their brain matter was protected under a crusty coating or a glistening, clear membrane. 

Also known as 'Brain Dogs', they were capable of magically consuming a humanoid creature's mind and memories from a distance of up to 10 feet (3 meters), provided that creature had a brain and succumbed to its psychic assault. If so, the victim's mentality was deteriorated. In the worst case, the victim's intellectual capacity was completely erased, leaving them dazed or stunned and ultimately incapacitated. Once their victims were left in this state of stupor, the Intellect Devourer would attack with its claws, opening wounds through which it would merge with its host by compressing its body to a suitable size. 

Naturally cautious, Intellect Devourers preferred to work only in the dark and stalk their prey until an opportune moment presented itself."

Lazy by nature, brutish, notoriously quick-tempered, they often distrusted one another and squabbled over treasure and especially food. Much like hill giants, ogres were gluttonous creatures willing to eat almost anything. They enjoyed the taste of raw dwarf flesh, but would also eat halfling or elf flesh when they could get it. They would often use the skin and bones of their prey to fashion crude loincloths and necklaces.

Ogres were known to typically associate with goblinoids, orcs, and their fellow giant-kin trolls. In the social structure of the giants, the Ordning, ogres were considered the lowest-ranked of all giant-kin. Because of this, they were typically found to be willing servants of giants and quick to take up mercenary work in the hopes of easy plunder."

#name "Phaerimm"
#descr "Phaerimms fed on magic and were malevolent and highly intelligent aberrations. They specialized in mind-controlling spells, which were so strong that they could control nearly any creature, including powerful ones such as beholders and mind flayers. A negative side-effect of phaerimm magic was that it drained moisture from the surrounding area. Extensive use of this magic led to the creation of the infamous Anauroch desert. Phaerimms had a degree of natural resistance to nearly all effects and spells. Additionally, they also had the natural ability to absorb or deflect any spell cast on them (which we can't model in Dominions 6 well, for now). 

Phaerimms dated back to the Days of Thunder. The wizards of the sarrukh empire battled the Phaerimm, and although the sarrukh succeeded in driving the phaerimms deep into the Underdark, the massive ecological change resulting from the war caused the sarrukh empire to collapse. The Phaerimm have been responsible for the destruction of several empires since, including Netheril and the dwarven Northkingdom, Delzoun. In 329, the Sharns finally defeated the Phaerimm, erecting the Sharn Wall beneath Anauroch, trapping the Phaerimm within the place now known as the Buried Realms.

1346 DR, a portal to Avernus was erected in the Burial Glen of Myth Drannor by a cabal of Alhoon - undead Mindflayer liches. They worked alongside banite priests of the Zhentarim and others with the intent to draw devils from the 9 hells to help deal with the Phaerimm menace within the ruins. This led, eventually, to the breaching of the Sharn Wall and the release of the Phaerimm to wreak havoc across the continent once more."

#name "Tomb Tapper"
#descr "Thaalud, more commonly known as tomb tappers or the faceless, were intelligent constructs designed by the ancient Netherese empire to defend it against the depredations of the phaerimm. Their existence can be traced back to the very beginning of the Shadowed Age of Netheril's history, when a group of arcanists created them to seek out the source of the magical drain that was beginning to reach across Netheril.

Tomb tappers were 15 ft (4.6 m) tall, naked, sexless, hairless humanoids with hard, smooth blue-gray skin, claws that could dig through solid rock, and great toothed mouths in their bellies. Their featureless heads earned them the nickname, 'the faceless.'

A tomb tapper retained the memories of its ancestors, which meant that their behavior over many generations still adhered closely to their original 'programming' to collect magic items and slay non-human spellcasters. They further had an almost compulsive drive to amuse themselves by molding the rock around them into twisting shapes.

Tomb tappers received their name from their habit of burrowing into the depths to plunder tombs, temples, and caves in search of magic items, which they carried off. They usually tried to seize magic from living beings that they encountered as well, having little respect for the difference between a living or a dead owner of a magical object.

Tomb tappers were known to lend aid to dwarves and deep gnomes, but were known to be hostile toward drow, duergar, mind flayers, and umber hulks. Their primary enemy was the phaerimm, for whom they were specifically created to destroy."

Vhaeraun was the son of Llolth and Corellon Larethian. He held the unique view among drow that males and females were equally valuable and was primarily prayed to by those drow males who sought a better life than slavery under Lolth's matriarchy. 'Why are things so cruel and divisive? Why isn't there more harmony, mutual enjoyment, and common growth in power? Why, after thousands of years, are we still all stuck in this one cavern?' - all of these were questions to which Vhaeraun provided both answer and solution.

He was arrogant, like all drow gods, believing himself and his people to above all others. Despite this, he was also willing to cooperate when it came to undermining and fighting his mother, Llolth, and tried to unite the other drow gods against her. He also held that all elvenkind should be united in this cause. Followers of both Mask and Shar were seen as valuable allies. 

He was actively involved in the lives of his followers, both personally and via emissaries and discouraged self-sacrifice and martyrdom, believing that tomorrow would always bring new and often better opportunities to advance drow power and undermine his mother's dominance over the dark-elves."

#descr "Kiaransalee (pronounced: KEE-uh-RAN-sa-lee) was the drow goddess of revenge and undeath. She was a former necromancer queen consumed by thoughts of retribution. Revered as The Lady of the Dead, the Vengeful Banshee, and sometimes The Revenancer, she was driven insane ages ago, yet retained her twisted cunning, recalling clearly every slight towards her whether real or imagined. 

Kiaransalee's clergy comprised of orderly regimented cells, but the faith lacked in overall organization. The Revenancer's clerics were mostly found in small drow communities or in special enclaves, and acted constantly in secret. Her clerics were agents of vengeance who plotted against anyone who ever slighted the faith. They regularly organised slaying missions to acquire corpses for animation, and were very active in persecuting slaves. Higher-ranking priestesses were called Yathrinshee. Many clerics were also necromancers. A few of the church also joined the Cult of the Dragon and became Wearers of Purple. Eventually, most became undead themselves. 

The single annual holy day of the faith was called the Graverending and was celebrated each Midwinter Eve. The Graverending was an individual ritual, where each cleric animated as many undead as she could handle. These undead were known as the Vengeance Hunters and they were consumed only with a desire for revenge against those that ended their lives. The ensuing 24 hours were harrowing for the realms, particularly for political leaders, soldiers, and prison guards who wardened over convicted killers. In a few places, it was customary to open the prison doors on Midwinter Eve and let justice be met."

#descr "Ghaunadaur (pronounced: GON-ah-dawr) was a greater god of abominations, oozes, and outcasts believed to be touched by the Far Realm. Most commonly referred to as That Which Lurks, Ghaunadaur was a member of the drow pantheon but broke off following the War of the Spider Queen. Even Llolth respected Ghaunadaur, saying to her daughter Eilistraee, 'The Ancient One heeds no Mistress. Ghaunadaur was old even before Ao's time. The god of slime comes and goes as he will. I neither command nor compel him.'

Ghaunadaur was an unpredictable deity. False worshipers were sometimes rewarded by it, occasionally even with permanent magical boons, but they might just as well have been devoured by the Elder Eye without a second thought. He was thought to have no allies, though Moander and Jublex were certainly kindred deities. Some believed the two of them to be aspects of Ghaunadaur and not true deities themselves.

The church of Ghaunadaur consisted of cults scattered throughout the Underdark, each dominated by a single individual. There were only a few drow and aboleth cities that served as exceptions, with a more organized clergy. The main duty of Ghaundaur's clerics was to ensure, in any way necessary, that Ghaunadaur's altars were supplied with a steady supply of sacrifices. These individuals would be drugged and compelled to ascend to an altar where the leading cleric would pray and then turn into slime, enveloping the victims and consuming them. However, most of the prayers and rituals the Ghaunadans directed to the Lord of Slime were as ill-defined and amorphous as their god. Each cleric manifested prayers in the manner they saw fit and no cleric would suspect a worshiper of treachery or blasphemy for uttering nonsense or unintelligible gibberish. 

That Which Lurks was easily compelled to send an avatar to his followers if it meant an opportunity to consume a multitude of the willing, something the Ghaunadaur relished."

Bloodfire oozes radiated tremendous heat from their bodies and reeked of the smell of sulfur. Whenever they absorbed the faces manifested on them, clouds of poisonous sulfuric gas would be disgorged like an infernal burp.

These creatures were impervious to harm from elemental fire and radiated sufficient heat to cause flesh to sear and cloth to ignite. They spewed flame and poisonous sulfuric gases as well as their radiating flame shield. They were known to be vulnerable to cold-based attacks.

The flames are such that a fire gem crystalizes within their roiling folds and can be gathered through careful telekinetic extraction each month.

The Phaerimm were known to employ Bloodfire Oozes, as were the Red Wizards of Thay, where they were often created as guardians of laboratories, temples, and other important locales. Priests of Orcus and other demon princes were also keen to craft Bloodfire Oozes. The worshippers of Ghaunadaur were known, in dire situations, to employ them as well - however, they were extremely cautious in this endeavor as fire was a sure method of causing harm to most other oozes."

#name "Gelatinous Cube"
#descr "A gelatinous cube, also known as an athcoid, was a transparent ooze composed of mindless, gelatinous matter in the shape of a cube or rhombohedron. They were especially favored by the god Ghaunadaur. 

These predators silently roamed ancient crypts and vaults in regular, predictable patterns. As they traveled the halls of old ruins, they absorbed any material in their paths from the floors and walls. Although incapable of climbing walls, particularly large gelatinous cubes could also absorb mold and moss from ceilings. Organic material was quickly dissolved in the acidic ooze that made up the cube's body, while bones and inorganic matter spent some time floating within the creature until eventually expelled. As they slid through the corridors, they left behind a perfectly clean path, except for an occasional slimy trail.

Regardless of their sizes and homogeneous composition, gelatinous cubes were vulnerable to most usual forms of attack, although reports existed of cubes that were immune to electricity. 

The Waterdhavian dungeon complex of Undermountain contained numerous gelatinous cubes, and these creatures were commonplace in the underdark where they could grow to enormous sizes."

#descr "Oblexes were designed by mind flayers with the purpose to serve as advance scouts to search for prey to feed a colony. However, oblexes did not act on their master's orders. Rather, their actions were purely motivated by hunger. An oblex within the telepathic range of an elder brain would instinctively, and unwittingly, inform the colony of any sentient creatures just by its endless hunger for memories and attraction to intelligent individuals. 

They were capable of using the memories of those they had consumed to create credible replicas of their victims, which they then used to further hunt and feed. These impersonations, made of the same ooze as the oblex, were nearly identical to the original victims, except for a faint smell of sulfur. They could move up to 120 feet (37 meters) from the oblex, but could not entirely separate from its body. A replica remained attached to the oblex's main body by a thin, transparent tether made of slime, which could pass through extremely tight spaces as narrow as 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) wide.

The oblex reproduction cycle was intrinsically connected to its feeding habits. As an oblex fed, it slowly became saturated with its victims' accumulated memories and personalities. Eventually, a saturated oblex had to split into smaller creatures in order to avoid going insane."

#descr "Ghaunadans were intelligent oozes that served the deity Ghaunadaur. They were active across the Underdark, and preferred to live near other slimes and oozes, whom they would lead.  

In their natural state, Ghaunadans looked like a green slime, but they were natural shapechangers capable of shifting between this ooze form and a humanoid form. They always took on a pleasant and attractive humanoid form and enjoyed donning garish colors and metallic lustre. Their pleasing appearance hid a vile intelligence, however, and they were devout servants of their evil god. 

In their humanoid form, ghaunadans could charm people simply by looking into their eyes, producing an effect similar to the friends spell that lasted as long as the ghaunadan remained in sight and in their humanoid form. They used this ability to win friends in areas populated by humanoids, and to avoid detection and the watchful eye of authorities. In this way, they were able to subtly spread their dark faith and bring many sacrifices to their hidden temples. Several ghaunadans made their home in Undermountain beneath Waterdeep and made their way to the city's poorer districts to tempt suitably desperate individuals to either join their cult or be consumed in their rituals.

In combat, Ghaunadans were adept at waiting for the opponents to strike, then enveloping their weapons in an effort to disarm them. They were outstanding and effective grapplers as well, capable of immobilizing their assailants with wholly unnatural holds and leverage points even capable wrestlers were unable to comprehend."

In combat, a Stonereaver is a living mountain, a stony redoubt that provides shelter to his allies while crashing like an avalanche upon his enemies. The ground shifts and churns under his feet.

Mindmasters are the chief clergy of Deep Duerra, the duergar goddess of war, conquest, and psionics.

Unlike other dwarves, duergar had a strong tradition of magic, both in the divine and arcane varieties, and duergar clerics, runecasters, runesmiths, and wizards were highly respected for their skill. Clerics were fairly common, serving the duergar gods in order to gain power and influence within society.

In particular, the duergar had a fondness for magically crafted items that they could use to aid them in combat, protect their minds against tampering, or to hide from enemy senses.

'The mental power that duergar wield was given to them by illithids. But why would illithids create servants who could turn invisible or grow to ogre size?

Most likely because those servants would excel at herding their masters' other minions. In retrospect, it seems arguable that duergar escaped bondage because their jailers had given them the keys.'

#descr "The oppressive matriarchal society of the drow left little hope of station or respect for male children. Few were seen as worthwhile members of society unless they possessed rare gifts for arcane magic or talent in combat. Fewer still were even given the chance for training. Young boys lived only slightly better lives than slaves and were thrown into the same role on the battlefield - front line troops and raiders. That said, the only way to ensure a worse fate than theirs was to show cowardice and thus, the drow Sargtlin were reliable in the face of any foe.

- Dark Elves - 
Drow, also known as dark elves, were a sub-race of elves that predominantly lived in the Underdark. They were hated and feared due to their cruelty, though some non-evil and an even smaller number of good drow existed.

The moral code of the average drow was informed by the teachings of Lolth. From birth, the drow were taught that they were superior to other races, and as such they believed themselves to be the ultimate beings. This mindset created an arrogance so strong that drow could be incapable of viewing other creatures as their equals, including members of their own kind; almost every drow believed themselves to be the epitome of their superior species. The treatment reserved for non-drow ran the entire gamut from pets, to slaves, to grudgingly respected partners if they proved themselves a military match for them, though never equals. As one might expect, this atmosphere of utter condescension meant that most drow generally felt entitled to do whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted to do it."

#descr "A black pudding was an ooze resembling a bubbling, heaping pile of thick black goo.  Like other slimes and oozes, these creatures were mindless underground-dwelling hunters and scavengers that wandered and absorbed whatever they found. Black pudding attacked by grabbing, grappling, and constricting prey directly into their liquid-esque mass. Like other oozes, they also secreted a deadly acidic substance which strongly and quickly dissolved weapons, clothing, and organic tissue alike. 

Some black puddings that managed to survive for a very long time came to be known as elder black puddings, they were significantly bigger than their younger counterparts and had an almost impenetrable outer layer of aged material. The city of Luskan used one such creature as an agent of their city waste management system, feeding it over many decades until it became so large and powerful, it threatened the city itself and required specialized removal."

Some elder black puddings were believed to be conscious and capable of absorbing the thoughts and memories of those they consumed. They were capable linking telepathically with humanoids and driving their dark and alien thoughts into their minds, rendering them paralyzed. They also seemed to maintain some form of telepathic control over slimes and oozes nearby, leading them forward to some dark purpose.

Such puddings were considered sacred by the church of Ghaunadaur and are believed to recieve the Ooze Lord's blessings."

Even if they might not hold titles of Laird, sit on the Councils, or count the Deepking from among their theological leaders, the clergy of Ladaguer quietly steered politics in duergar realms. 

They most venerated among the faithful were known as the Thuldor ('those who endure') and they kept the race united and powerful against the many threats in the Underdark. They were expected to serve in the military, like all other members of duergar society.

Many temples included large stables used to care for and breed steeders: large, monstrous riding spiders."

#descr "Steeders were a species of giant spider found in the Underdark. They were domesticated by the duergar and employed as mounts. Female steeders were used in battle while the smaller males were used to transport cargo.  Duergar rode on their backs in a specialized saddle bearing a complicated system of prods and straps which allowed the rider to control and direct the massive spider. 

There was demand for steeder eggs, with an individual egg fetching up to 500 gp at the market. By the 1370s DR, the sale of steeder eggs was permitted to non-duergar races. Steeders had to be properly trained and a steeder trainer was considered a professional trade among the duergar. An experienced steeder trainer could charge up to 1,000 gp for their services. 

Many temples of Laduguer included large stables used to care for and breed these creatures. The drow goddess, Llolth, was furious regarding the duergar's practice of trafficking spiders and using them as simple beasts of burden."

#descr "Laduguer (pronounced: LA-duh-gwur) was the lawful evil dwarven deity of the duergar. The Exile harboured a bitter resentment against the rest of the Morndinsamman ever since he was cast out, although he maintained he left voluntarily.  The Gray Protector was a xenophobic god with a doctrine of empowerment through slave exploitation and protection through an unforgiving military program, urging his followers to avoid contact with other races save for limited trade and slave raids.

As a rule, Laduguer was grim, gloomy, and absent of joy. He was supremely lawful, but while doubtlessly also evil-inclined, much of this was evil turned inwards, bitterness towards rejection and underappreciation. Despite viewing his peers as obsessing with tradition at the expense of progress, he was not a free-thinker himself but a harsh and unbending taskmaster who adhered strictly to his own brand of intolerant discipline. He demanded his duergar engage in constant toil under harsh conditions, but did reward their dilligence through his protection and teachings on how to craft magical items.

Laduguer had been exiled from the Morndinsamman. The gold and shield dwarves claimed he committed unspeakable crimes and was only saved from Moradin's wrath by Berronar Truesilver. The grey dwarves, however, said he was an advocate of righteous, innovative philosophy that offended Moradin so much that he cast him out.

In 1383 DR, Laduguer and Deep Duerra were both destroyed and their home plane of Hammergrim dispersed into the Astral Plane. Most Worshipers of Laduguer did not realize this, however, and Asmodeus took up the guise of the grey dwarven god in an effort to gain more followers. The Duergar began making pacts with devils as a result, securing infernal power for themselves."

Ever the imperialist, the Axe Princess of Conquest was a resolute believer in the supremacy of psionics and the destiny of the duergar to rule all the Underdark.

For as long as Duerra had been a divine being, she had been exiled from the Morndinsamman, and she had shown no interest in trying to remedy the relationship.  Even Ladaguer, who raised her from a mortal to a demigod, was little more than an annoyance and she made moves to replace him numerous times as the chief god of the Gray Dwarves. The beholder god Gzemnid, the entire drow pantheon, the myserious gods of the Aboleths and Kuo-toa were all her sworn enemies. Her greatest foe, however, was the Great Brain of the Illithids.  

Duerra's deeds in the ancient past had long since become myth. Long before she ascended to the ranks of the divine, Duerra was the greatest queen of the duergar, both an empress and warrior who ruled over an immense subterranean empire. In -1850 DR, with her at the front of the forces, the grim duergar soldiers of the Underspires launched a series of strikes against the illithids of Oryndoll who had enslaved her people more than a milliennia prior. It was on one of these occasions, according to dubious tales and legends, that Deep Duerra's forces overran the city of Oryndoll, shackling the resident mind flayers that had once done the same to them. Over the course a century, Duerra and her surgeons supposedly wrestled many secrets and powers of psionics from the minds of the captive illithids. So great was her psionic might, so the legends said, that she turned the entire illithid colony into her thralls. Of course, these are only legends..."

Furthermore, flameskulls steadily regenerated all damage taken and could even reassemble themselves within just a few days after being completely shattered. Only dousing the broken fragments of their skulls with holy water or performing a dispelling ritual could ensure they remained silent. 

In the tunnels below the city of Myratma in Tethyr, the mummy sorceress Kalloch built an army of undead, including flameskulls, ghasts, ghouls, and others. In Waterdeep's Pharra's Alley, the Circle of Skulls were a regular appearance, flying in a circle and arguing with each other. Unpredictable, they aided some by giving information, but attacked those who irritated them. The Mad Mage Halaster created a number of flameskulls to guard his lair and surrounding caverns.

#name "Slimy Dapperling"
#descr "The Slimy Dapperlings were the name given to little sprouts who exuded a hallucinatory goo. Their entire bodies dripped with the slippery stuff and their pudgy bodies exploded in a spray of it if they were killed in combat. Difficult to resist, the effect was both physiscally weakening as well as visually distorting, leaving those who failed to avoid contact with the slime much less effective in combat. 

Like Tawny Webcaps, the Slimy Dapperlings were often seen in loose formations. And like all Myconids, the dapperlings were reliant on the soils of their birthplaces.

Myconids, also known as fungus folk, were a race of ambulatory fungus creatures. They were known for their peacefulness and appreciation of quiet, making their homes in the darker corners of the world.

The life of a myconid was strictly scheduled and split evenly between sleep, work and 'melding'. Melding was the core of myconid society, with separation from the process viewed as a frightening and pitiful fate. Violence and disharmony was near unheard of within myconid societies as it adversely impacted the melding process and was largely unneeded.

Although the majority of the fungus folk were peaceful, there existed a far more insidious variant of their kind. Contrary to the gradual growth of normal myconid communities they were heavily expansionist, seeking to quickly grow in both number and territory. In spite of their change in basic behavior they were not known to be evil."

Their red caps split open when they were engaged, revealing a mass of surprisingly strong and poisonous tentacles that were capable of not only dishing out blunt force trauma, but also delivering a flaming, stinging poison. The sheer quantity of them as well as their ability to change rapidly in diameter, meant armor was of little protection against this nasty substance. The tentacles could also picking up nearby objects and hurl them over a reasonably long distance. Close quarters combat with the Scourgecaps was a deadly proposition. Scouragecaps were also capable of entering a wild, bloodthirsty frenzy despite their normally docile and friendly demeanors."

While not particularly effective in combat, they were able to venture farther from home than others of their kind in search of resources to expand their fungal demesne. In fact, they were often seen far from home, working together to drag the corpses of large creatures back to their colonies for reanimation.

Like all myconids, they had little interest in moral and ethical codes, seeing the lives and possessions of nonmyconids as perfectly reasonable and valid to gather, even if it meant conflict. Golden Grisettes were especially prized by Zuggtmoy, the Demon Queen of the myconids, for their dedication to these tasks."

#name "Demon Queen of Fungi"
#descr "Zuggtmoy was the Demon Queen of Fungi, but not considered a true patron of fungi. She was merely the embodiment of the death and virulence that fungi represented, and fully willing to subvert the natural order for her own ends. The Lady of Rot and Decay did not use decomposition for the higher purposes of renewal or rebirth, desiring destruction purely for its own sake.

Zuggtmoy was an utterly inhuman being, but could mold herself into roughly humanoid form. One often depicted form was a skeletally-thin humanoid draped and veiled in mycelium and lichen.

Zuggtmoy had a difficult time establishing effective cults in the Prime Material Plane, as worshiping fungi was not too appealing to the majority of humanoids. To counteract this, the Lady of Fungi was often worshiped through fake cults led by her few actual worshipers and manipulated in ways that supported her own initiatives.

Though small, there were some rare sects of devout fungi-worshipers, comprised mostly of misguided druids, clerics, and, to a lesser degree, maddened academics such as wizards. These insular collections often fantasized about the domination of fungi over their local surroundings.

In counterbalance to this, many more of her cultists followed her unwillingly and unknowingly, having somehow become infected with her spores, becoming either mind-controlled or transformed and serving as extensions of her will until they were utterly consumed. Like herself, they often exhibited only the illusion of normal sensibilities.

Zuggtmoy's influence extended most prominently with fungi themselves, with her ability to exert her will to demand their servitude and assistance. Alongside this, the demon lady, with the power of her status, could field powerful demons of varying strengths."

#name "The Great Fungus"
#descr "Psilofyr was the benign deity and archfey of the myconid race, known most recently as the Carrion King for his philosophy of renewal through decomposition. The enigmatic Lord of Myconids was poorly understood, even by his own people, yet nonetheless a powerful spiritual force and patron power of fungi.

The greatest desire of the Carrion King was clear to all who knew him: ensuring the continued longevity, prosperity, and spread of the myconid race. Despite being as unpredictable and dangerous as other Feywild lords, he lacked their self centered attitudes and mindsets. Unlike many other archfey he possessed a genuine fondness for the vigor and drive of short-lived mortals, rather than viewing them as playthings, pawns, or vermin.

Furthermore, he was not motivated in his propagation of the myconids and his adopted fungal creatures by a desire for personal glory, but rather for their own benefit. Although he was dogged about the spreading of the myconids he could be persuaded to slow down or spread passively, as he didn't destroy civilizations he saw as peaceful and beneficiary. Admired by many for his great hospitality, he showed an initial positivity towards all travelers in his realm, whether assassins or explorers.

His virtues aside however, the Spore Lord was undeniably mad, as the more forms he divided himself between the more unrepresentative of his whole self the aspects became. The core philosophy of the Myconid Lord, was that by which the needs of the many outweighed those of the few. The death of individuals was rarely considered important for both myconids and non-fungus friends alike, as the virtues of self-sacrifice and community duty was highly prevalent both in himself and his people. Indeed the Carrion King did not heavily value the lives of his individual aspects, as more could always be conjure. "

#descr "Chitines were humanoids that resembled spiders and were found in the Underdark. In the 13th century DR, chitines were created by the drow wizards of Ched Nasad as failed slave experiments. In the Year of the Creeping Fang, 1305 DR, the chitines rebelled from drow enslavement and founded Yathchol.

Chitines were about 4 feet (1.2 meters) tall and had four arms, each of which had an extra joint. Each of their hands and feet were embedded with claws, which allowed them to climb most surfaces. Their faces held faceted eyes and mandibles attached to their mouths. Chitines could spin webs from an opening in their stomach, and their skins secreted an oil which prevented them from sticking to their own webs.

When possible, chitines used their webs to create pitfall traps to catch enemies unawares. Their ambidexterity and hooks in their hands made them extremely difficult to disarm. They were, however, sensitive to sunlight and bright lights. Chitines would often wear web armor made from their own hardened web.

They worshipped Llolth despite their hatred of the drow. While devout worshippers, they were not known to practice arcane magic."

#descr "Chitines were adept at using their webbing as construction materials to build their homes. They usually lived in villages of 40–60 individuals inside a cavern filled with maze-like webs connecting domed houses located on the walls, ceilings, and floors. In the center of the cavern was always a temple to Lolth. The leaders of each village were priests known as choldriths.

Choldriths and their chitine communities were found throughout the upper and middle-Northdark, but the majority lived in several connected villages (at least seven in total) known cumulatively as Yathchol, located beneath the Far Forest. A few chitines also lived in the Spiderhaunt Wood in Shadowdale and in the area around Sshamath."

The Drow's command of arcane forces was on par with that of the surface realms and their society was as steeped in magic as Halruaa or Thay - such is the necessity of survival in the underdark. Drow were also not just avid inventors of magic items, but also the main crafters of magic items in the Underdark. Mages in drow society were also consummate summoners. In addition to using various conjurations to protect their cities, having demonic slaves was a sign of prestige for the drow that demonstrated the master's power and intimidated their enemies. "

Leaders among the race often came to power through betrayal or aggression rather than by more peaceful means, or as clerics of the goblin gods. Because of the violent nature of goblin culture, it was not uncommon for goblins to come under the domination of individuals from a larger, more physically powerful culture, most typically larger goblinoids such as hobgoblins or bugbears.

Being bullied by bigger, stronger creatures had taught goblins to exploit what few advantages they had, namely sheer numbers and malicious ingenuity. They favored ambushes, overwhelming odds, dirty tricks, and any other edges they could devise, the concept of a fair fight being meaningless in their society."

The crown killed Grugarin's lover, but spared him, leaving the old giant a heartless lich. He declared himself Deathking and set about his goal, gathering the displaced stone giant clans of long-forgotten Nedeheim and with them, refounded the kingdom, and called it Cairnheim. 

He ruled Cairnheim through fear alone. He considered wherever he was feared to be part of his kingdom and came to control several giant, orc, and goblin clans near , collected tribute from several human settlements in the Giant's Run mountain region and the Arnvault within the Underdark."

In addition to the basic humanoid skeleton, there were also skeletons created from wolves, trolls, ettins and even giants.

Animated skeletons were immune to mind-affecting spells; they could not be rendered unconscious and could not tire. Edged and piercing weapons, such as swords and arrows, were mostly ineffective against skeletons; only blunt weapons, such as warhammers, were effective at knocking the bones apart. Like other undead, skeletons could be repelled or destroyed outright by priests like paladins and clerics.

Arrogant and obsessed, the Archmage of Necromancy continued his experiments on the living and the dead as a god, paying no heed to the lesser lives lost in the name of his research and encouraging his disciples to do the same. Velsharoon's favored manifestation was a burning skull, wreathed in red, pale blue or blue-green flames.

As a Red Wizard of Thay, Velsharoon fought a spell-battle to a draw against Omm Hlandrar of Halruaa in the skies over the Shaar in the Year of the Sacrificed Fortune, 827 DR. He had sought the position of Zulkir of Necromancy, but he feuded with several other Red Wizards, including his chief rival, Szass Tam, who drove him out of Thay. He was a chief rival of the Simbul in Aglarond and her lover, Elminster, neither of whom were capable of mustering the power to destroy him. In the Plains of Purple Dust, he discovered a process to achieve demigodhood through means of a potion brewed from the blood of adventurers. By the late 1350s DR, those archmages who'd opposed him feared for their safety and for the safety and stability of the Realms. The infamy of his actions had traveled so far, that he was heard of even as far abroad as the Moonshae Isles. 

He served Talos for a time and was granted Cyric's portfolio over necromancy after that god's death. He turned his allegiance to Azuth eventually and began flirting with Shar. He was a known ally of Kiaransalee, the drow goddess of necromancy, and maintained a fierce rivalry with Myrkul, whom he considered a do-nothing."

Mummies caused fear in the living on sight, and any creature they touched was affected by a rotting curse called mummy rot. These undead creatures could only be harmed by magical or enchanted weapons, and even these tools were only partially effective. They possessed enormous strength and magical resistances. Fire, however, was the bane of their existence. Adventurers wandering through ancient tombs were keen to keep torches lit, even when magical means of shedding light was available.

Used most often as undead guardians of tombs and the vaults of honored dead, mummies patrolled their homes with dedication, remaining alert for signs of tomb robbers or others who would defile their assigned lair. In their state of undead existence, mummies felt hatred to all living things, attacking every creature in their way indiscriminately."

Many males wishing for better opportunities than the absolute subservience reserved to them among the followers of Lolth, were drawn to Vhaeraun. 

Collectively, the clergy was known as 'the Masked.' Novices were called The Uncloaked, and those past that stage were called Nightshadows. Unlike the drow churches of Llolth or Eilistraee, the church of Vhaeraun was loosely organized in largely autonomous cells. Mainly due to persecution from the priestesses of Lolth, who ruled over the majority of the drow race, there was little expectation of adherence to any dogma or scripture - only the goal of undermining Llolth from the shadows."

#name "Death Knight Dreadlord"
#descr "The Death Knight Dreadlord was a once-mortal champion now reborn through dark magic into an undying commander of the undead. This formidable figure was originally a paladin or knight of considerable renown, sworn to uphold justice and righteousness but fell from grace through a profound betrayal or an unforgivable act that led to a curse of eternal undeath. Unlike common undead, the transformation into a Dreadlord is a result of a pact with dark powers, a deliberate seeking of forbidden knowledge, or a divine curse for transgressions against the gods.

The creation of a Death Knight Dreadlord is a rare event, often involving elaborate rituals, the alignment of malevolent cosmic forces, or direct intervention by a deity of death, such as Myrkul or Shar. These beings are not merely undead warriors; they are necromantic masters imbued with the dark energy of the Shadowfell, possessing not only unparalleled martial prowess but also significant spellcasting abilities, particularly in the schools of necromancy and evocation.

Dreadlords are immortal, though their timeline for return is often inconsistent. Where they walk, they bathe the landscape in an aura of fear and act as a beacon to lesser undead creatures who simply happen to exist within a 200-mile radius. These creatures remain in the service of the Death Knight until destroyed."

The creation of a Deathshroud Knight is no minor feat. It requires a powerful act of necromancy, often involving the binding of the knight's soul to their armor and weapon, creating a fusion of spirit and steel that is nearly indestructible. In battle, Deathshroud Knights are formidable, capable of unleashing devastating attacks imbued with necrotic energy.

#descr "Chitines were humanoids that resembled spiders and were found in the Underdark. In the 13th century DR, chitines were created by the drow wizards of Ched Nasad as failed slave experiments. In the Year of the Creeping Fang, 1305 DR, the chitines rebelled from drow enslavement and founded Yathchol.

Chitines were about 4 feet (1.2 meters) tall and had four arms, each of which had an extra joint. Each of their hands and feet were embedded with claws, which allowed them to climb most surfaces. Their faces held faceted eyes and mandibles attached to their mouths. Chitines could spin webs from an opening in their stomach, and their skins secreted an oil which prevented them from sticking to their own webs.

When possible, chitines used their webs to create pitfall traps to catch enemies unawares. Their ambidexterity and hooks in their hands made them extremely difficult to disarm. They were, however, sensitive to sunlight and bright lights. Chitines would often wear web armor made from their own hardened web.

They worshipped Llolth despite their hatred of the drow. While devout worshippers, they were not known to practice arcane magic."

#descr "A bloodfire ooze is the unholy result of mixing an immense quantity of blood from innocent beings with the ichor of a demon. It is dimly aware of its surroundings and burns with intense heat. These amorphous oozes resembled a slithering mass of seething and boiling blood. Occasionally they manifested faces that were twisted in torment, which were personifications of its demonic essence and often resembled the faces of those whose blood was sacrificed to create them. Bloodfire oozes radiated tremendous heat from their bodies and reeked of the smell of sulfur. Whenever they absorbed the faces manifested on them, clouds of poisonous sulfuric gas would be disgorged like an infernal burp.

These creatures were impervious to harm from elemental fire and radiated sufficient heat to cause flesh to sear and cloth to ignite. They spewed flame and poisonous sulfuric gases as well as their radiating flame shield. They were known to be vulnerable to cold-based attacks.

The flames are such that a fire gem crystalizes within their roiling folds and can be gathered through careful telekinetic extraction each month.

The Phaerimm were known to employ Bloodfire Oozes, as were the Red Wizards of Thay, where they were often created as guardians of laboratories, temples, and other important locales. Priests of Orcus and other demon princes were also keen to craft Bloodfire Oozes. The worshippers of Ghaunadaur were known, in dire situations, to employ them as well - however, they were extremely cautious in this endeavor as fire was a sure method of causing harm to most other oozes."

#descr "Oblexes were designed by mind flayers with the purpose to serve as advance scouts to search for prey to feed a colony. However, oblexes did not act on their master's orders. Rather, their actions were purely motivated by hunger. An oblex within the telepathic range of an elder brain would instinctively, and unwittingly, inform the colony of any sentient creatures just by its endless hunger for memories and attraction to intelligent individuals. 

They were capable of using the memories of those they had consumed to create credible replicas of their victims, which they then used to further hunt and feed. These impersonations, made of the same ooze as the oblex, were nearly identical to the original victims, except for a faint smell of sulfur. They could move up to 120 feet (37 meters) from the oblex, but could not entirely separate from its body. A replica remained attached to the oblex's main body by a thin, transparent tether made of slime, which could pass through extremely tight spaces as narrow as 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) wide.

The oblex reproduction cycle was intrinsically connected to its feeding habits. As an oblex fed, it slowly became saturated with its victims' accumulated memories and personalities. Eventually, a saturated oblex had to split into smaller creatures in order to avoid going insane."

#descr "A black pudding was an ooze resembling a bubbling, heaping pile of thick black goo.  Like other slimes and oozes, these creatures were mindless underground-dwelling hunters and scavengers that wandered and absorbed whatever they found. Black pudding attacked by grabbing, grappling, and constricting prey directly into their liquid-esque mass. Like other oozes, they also secreted a deadly acidic substance which strongly and quickly dissolved weapons, clothing, and organic tissue alike. 

Some black puddings that managed to survive for a very long time came to be known as elder black puddings, they were significantly bigger than their younger counterparts and had an almost impenetrable outer layer of aged material. The city of Luskan used one such creature as an agent of their city waste management system, feeding it over many decades until it became so large and powerful, it threatened the city itself and required specialized removal."

They were capable linking telepathically with humanoids and driving their dark and alien thoughts into their minds, rendering them paralyzed.

Such puddings were considered sacred by the church of Ghaunadaur and are believed to recieve the Ooze Lord's blessings."

#descr "Ghaunadans were intelligent oozes that served the deity Ghaunadaur. They were active across the Underdark, and preferred to live near other slimes and oozes, whom they would lead.  

In their natural state, Ghaunadans looked like a green slime, but they were natural shapechangers capable of shifting between this ooze form and a humanoid form. They always took on a pleasant and attractive humanoid form and enjoyed donning garish colors and metallic lustre. Their pleasing appearance hid a vile intelligence, however, and they were devout servants of their evil god. 

In their humanoid form, ghaunadans could charm people simply by looking into their eyes, producing an effect similar to the friends spell that lasted as long as the ghaunadan remained in sight and in their humanoid form. They used this ability to win friends in areas populated by humanoids, and to avoid detection and the watchful eye of authorities. In this way, they were able to subtly spread their dark faith and bring many sacrifices to their hidden temples. Several ghaunadans made their home in Undermountain beneath Waterdeep and made their way to the city's poorer districts to tempt suitably desperate individuals to either join their cult or be consumed in their rituals.

In combat, Ghaunadans were adept at waiting for the opponents to strike, then enveloping their weapons in an effort to disarm them. They were outstanding and effective grapplers as well, capable of immobilizing their assailants with wholly unnatural holds and leverage points even capable wrestlers were unable to comprehend."

#name "The Undying Temple"
#descr "The Undying Temple was a living temple dedicated to Kiaransalee in Castle Maerimydra. It was summoned by Irae T'sarran during the Silence of Lolth. 

The Undying Temple appeared as a tower of ribbed black stone that curved gracefully up to a point. The structure curved around an enormous floating orb of negative energy that absorbed all light around it. Another identical spiraling tower mirrored the first, albeit on the ethereal plane, and hung upside down so that both towers cradled the gigantic sphere.

As a sentient creature, the Undying Temple was unlike most other structures; it was able to plan and co-ordinate its own defenses so that it could take a pro-active role in protecting itself and the denizens within. Merely passing into the stalactite cavern where the Undying Temple was located rendered intruders subject to its telepathic and blindsight senses, making it almost impossible to sneak into the temple. Once the Undying Temple had noticed nearby creatures, it generally employed its powers to divine their intentions. If necessary, the temple would attempt to dominate dangerous warriors whilst summoning and warning the other defenders within.

In 1372 DR, Irae T'sarran cast a miracle spell to summon the Undying Temple to Castle Maerimydra. Irae then moved her operations in Maerimydra to the Undying Temple and continued her research into her great revenance spell under the Temple's watchful gaze.

Combining the traits of both a construct and the undead, the Undying Temple was immune to most attacks that would harm a living creature and its magically enhanced walls were even resistant to attacks like disintegrate. Additionally, it was healed by negative energy, but despite these robust features it was susceptible to harm by positive energy."

#nametype 270 -- Drow female 
#descr "Irae T'sarran was a female drow high priestess of Kiaransalee who attempted to exact her goddess's vengeance upon the surface lands by raising an army of the undead beneath the Dalelands.

On her right hand was a fine metal guantlet known as the Claw of the Revenancer, a powerful artifact given to her by her goddess and capable of creating Silveraiths. 

During Irae T'sarran's youth, she was a young noble of House T'sarran in Maerimydra. However, one day while Irae was away from the city, the other drow noble houses of the city turned a blind eye to the destruction of the rest of her house by a rival. This event caused her to turn to Kiaransalee, the drow deity of vengence, and with the few remaining survivors of House T'sarran's destruction she hid in Maerimydra until she could enact her vengeance. 

Irae's opportunity arrived in the wake of the Silence of Lolth, in 1372 DR, when the clergy of Lolth in Maerimydra were stripped of their powers. On Elient 23 the archmage of the city, Duneth Wharreil and his allies of ogres, giants and demons enacted their long-held plan to conquer the city for themselves. As the chaos of their assault unfolded, Irae and her cult followers eradicated the House Chûmavh, the ruling house that permitted House T'sarran's destruction, and by Elient 28 and taken control of Castle Maerimydra for themselves."

#name "Marilith"
#descr "Mariliths were Type IV militant tanar'ri known for their ability to utilize cold logic. They served as the brilliant tacticians of Abyssal hordes, advisors to demonic nobility, and in some cases acted as serpentine demon queens themselves. Eager as they were to bring pain and betrayal to others, their malice was accompanied by shrewdness and cunning. They were highly intelligent beings with their brilliance thriving in matters of army-level tactics. Their rare ability to unite and coordinate the actions of other demons made them a truly formidable foe in their endless Blood War against the devils for control of the 9 Hells. 

Mariliths eagerly joined melee combat if given the chance. They could swiftly strike with each weapon in their six hands, typically longswords or scimitars. Their tails were capable of moving like a whip or constricting their foes. Marilith wizards were truly terrifying beings. Not only did they not specialize in any one given school, but they had the rare power to cast spells with two of their arms while still fighting with two others.

They were able to gate in a large variety of other types of tanar'ri."

#name "Succubus"
#descr "A succubus was a type of demon - a beautiful lesser breed of tanar'ri from the Infinite Layers of the Abyss. They existed to seduce and tempt mortals and ultimately slay them and take their life energy back to the Abyss. Demonic succubi lived to seduce and tempt mortal beings of the Prime Material Plane, and in the end slay them and carry their life-forces back with them. The destruction of mortals increased the power of the Abyss and in turn aided the demons in the Blood War. Many succubi were engaged almost constantly working to corrupt mortals, usually via promises of sex and other pleasures.

Some succubi, despite their demonic heritage, came to serve higher-ranking devils instead - tempted as they were to switch sides during the Blood War. Acting as spies and as emissaries for their new devil master, such traitorous succubi were hunted by demons with special relish. 

Succubi had an array of terrifying powers. Their kiss was deadly, though they could use it instead as a powerful charm if they wished, which was often their preference when working for devils rather than demons. They could read minds, become ethereal at will to pass through doors or walls or to avoid mundane weapons, could planeshift and could teleport without error at will. They were immune to fire, electricity and poison; resistant to acid and cold, and were particularly resistant to magic as well."

#descr "Alu-fiends were the product of procreation between a succubus and a mortal (usually human). The male equivalent to an alu-fiend was generally called a cambion. Successive offspring from either (with mortals) were demonic tieflings.

Females were generally graceful and unfairly beautiful, and some went to great lengths to conceal their needle-like teeth and wings. Their uncontrollable sexual yearning was no doubt the product of their parentage. 

All alu-fiend's were agents of chaos in their own way, even if they resisted the lure of evil that lay in their hearts. Few became wizards, but many walked the path of sorcery through either sheer force of presence and will, or by virtue of the vices coursing through their infernal blood."

#name "Cambion"
#descr "The term cambion was often used to describe any male humanoid that was half-fiend. The meaning of the term has evolved over the years, with some researchers considering a true cambion having only come from the specific union of a planetouched mortal and a tanar'ri. There were further delineations of 'noble cambions' who were the offspring of demon lords. 

Cambions were painfully beautiful, if you could get past the fire red skin and eyes, the razor-sharp teeth, and their bat-like wings. All were agents of chaos and few males resisted the lure of evil that lay in their hearts. A few became wizards, but many more walked the path of sorcery through either sheer force of presence and will, or by virtue of the their infernal blood."

Their terrifying bays could cause permanent psychic trauma as they soared through the night, terrorizing their prey, and their wicked-sharp fangs could cut through steel. 

The hideous yeth hounds resembled lion-like mastiffs, standing 5'(1.5m) high at the shoulder and weighing about 400 lb (180kg). The smell of chilled smoke to indicate their presence, as their fur blended seamlessly into the shadows. Indeed, they feared sunlight, as well as weapons of silver or magic. 

Wicked hunters, the Yeth hounds were fundamentally obedient creatures, following the toughest member of the pack with complete deference. The only prize they sought was their prey, hungering for their terrified screams as they patiently tracked them down and then tore them limb from limb."

#name "Soneillon, The Youthful Crone"

#descr "Soneillon, also known as the Queen of Whispers and the Youthful Crone, was the demon lord of Spirac, the 71st layer of the Abyss. Throughout the centuries she spent in Faerûn, Soneillon spread unrest and fomented civil war across the nations of Chondath and Impiltur, nearly bringing complete ruin upon the realms.

As a demon lord, Soneillon held dominion over the concern for youth and rejuvenation. Within her domain existed a Pool of Rejuvenation that attracted travelers from across the planes in the hopes of drawing upon its power. An individual had to willingly sacrifice a portion of their free will to Soneillon, however, in order to use it.

As of the 14th century DR, Soneillon had forged her own kingdom on Faerun, which she called Naratyr. Her lair lay within the Giantspire Mountains of the Cold Lands in the heart of old Narfell.

Her influence over northeastern Faerun was not properly appreciated by many sages. In fact, very few scholars even knew that she was a demon lord. However, it was through her blood and her influence that the infernal arcane secrets of old Narfel were never truly lost, and, unlike Eltab, she found ways to resist being discovered and bound by her enemies time and again.

Wood elves saw themselves as guardians of the Tel-quessir forest homes that were largely abandoned after the Crown Wars and before the Retreat, but unlike most elves they did not view themselves as a people apart from the rest of Faerûn.

Wood elves were often stronger than other elves, but were frequently less cerebral than moon and sun elves, who put a greater value on education.

Compared with other Tel-quessir, wood elves had a notable disinterest in the arcane arts. To a wood elf, the wizard's spells were little different from the mason's castle walls or the tiller's plow—a means of controlling the natural world, which was contrary to the common ethic of living in harmony with nature rather than trying to dominate it that so many wood elves espoused."

They especially venerated Dagon, the Lord of the Darkened Depths who laired in the abyssal realm of the Shadowsea. Despite this demonic worship, however, they were not known to be directly evil. 

Nagas were first created by the sarrukh in the early days of Mhairshaulk as a servitor race by magically interbreeding magical serpents with humans, resulting in a powerful blend of intelligence and inquisitiveness. In their capacity as servitors, nagas served as guards, researchers, and explorers of uncharted lands. After the fall of Mhairshualk and the splitting of the World Serpent into five guises, the nagas began evolving into the five major sub-species of the race - Dark, Guardian, Spirit, Water, and Iridescent. Others have come to evolve or be created since."

Much larger than their naga kin, they were utterly evil and immortal. Cruel, aggressive, arrogant, and majestic, they faced any threat head-on, haughtily confident in their ability to tackle it. 

From their chins, Banelars sported beards of tentacles capable of wielding rings, wands, and other magical items. This, in addition to their poisonous bites and tails, made them formidable. Their command over the divine schools of Evil, Water, and Magic domains blended with the natural talents for sorcery enjoyed by all nagas. Banelars were not to be trifled with."

Their blood was strongly acidic, corroding metal and burning flesh if spilled or sprayed in combat. Even more enigmatic than the rest of their kind, they sought lost magic with fanaticism. Wholly evil, they delighted in causing suffering and death. 

They relished in their immortality, throwing caution to the wind in combat.  Their gaze attack was their most dreaded tool, capable of enslaving the minds of even the strong-willed. Spirit Nagas also possessed a deadly venomous bite and were capable sorcerers.

#brief "Brief: The City of Splendors is home to a truly cosmopolitan collection of peoples from across the realms."
#descr "Waterdeep was one of if not the most powerful and influential member-states of the Lords' Alliance, the coalition of nations and city-states that sought to maintain order along the Sword Coast and the North.

Waterdeep was ruled by a sixteen-seat council whose membership was largely secret. These hidden Lords of Waterdeep maintained their identities behind magical masks, called the Lord's Helm, and while they ruled in public, none knew the true identities of most of them. The subject of who the Lords were became a common topic of noble conversation, and some considered it a game to discover the Lords' identities, a game made more confusing by the fact the Lords themselves set their own rumors afloat."

#selectnation 201 -- can be any number from 200 up?
#era 2 		
#name "Luiren"
#epithet "Benevolent Anarchy of Halflings"
#idealcold 0
#brief "Brief: Lacking the umph of heavy infantry, Halflings make up for it by being bold, devious, and mirthful."
#descr "Luiren was known as the land of the halflings since its population was almost completely comprised of their race. It was a small kingdom with a population of about 840,000 inhabitants in 1372 DR ruled by the halfling theocrat Faran Ferromar. Travelers to Luiren were often surprised to find the locals adventurous and bold as opposed to the fat and quiet halflings one could find elsewhere. The capital city of Luiren was Beluir, a coastal city of 27,210 in 1372 DR in the longitudinal center of the realm. 

The subraces of Halflings exist on Faerun - the Lightfoots, Stronghearts, and Ghostwise. Around −100 DR, a ghostwise halfling cleric named Desva began leading the ghostwise in the worship of Malar the Beastlord and violence ensued. Savage acts were performed against the creatures and other halflings of the forest. The stronghearts and lightfoots allied against the ghostwise and battle continued for many years until Chand of the stronghearts slew Desva in −65 DR. Most of the surviving ghostwise left Luiren for the Chondalwood, making an oath that they wouldn't speak until they had atoned for their savagery. 

13 centuries later, the Ghostwise have returned, claiming the resurrected Desva leads them once again. Through guile and bloodshed, they've retaken the Luirwood. In the chaos, Feran Ferromar was given a vision from beyond the veil - that he would lead the lightfoots and stronghearts into righteous battle against these conquerors, he would face Desva in the deep forest of the Western Luirwood, and he would go on to lead the reformed nation of Luiren to become a great nation of the realms. This vision was both glorious and terrifying, for it was unclear if it was he or Desva who stood on the dais to accept the crown.   

This last bit is all very apocryphal, but Luiren needed something. Expect the unexpected with Luiren. The economic engine really can get going and you will have not only massive numbers of cheap troops but also the room to expand once you've retaken the Luirwood. Nearby halfling strongholds and lightfood villages will bring good recruitment options and bolster both your luck scales and your impressive gem income. The road forward is yours to pave."
#summary "Race: Dark-vision, naturally stealthy, and innately resistant to magic.
Military: Poorly armored and undergunned, find another way to win.
Magic: Nature, Air, and Earth, little Astral, and with the Ghostwise Malarites, Blood. Good research. 
Priests: Yondalla is the patron deity, but Peryroyl druids and Servants of Malar add interest.
Mechanics: "Rogue traders add economic boosts and tax collection from distant lands. Champion Outriders help boost local defenses each turn. Your little forts suck but your labs and temples are cheap."

#epithet "The Black Network"
#idealcold 0
#brief "As an extension of the will of the dark wizard Manshoon, the Zhentarim was initially formed as a mercenary company to support his rule over the Moonsea with the aim of spreading that control over all of Faerûn."
#descr "The Zhentarim, long known as the Black Network, was a mercenary company and greater mercantile organization in Faerûn. Over their 200 years of existence, they have had a storied history as a cadre of self-serving thieves, spies, assassins and malevolent wizards who, for a time, were indentured by their leaders to serve dark gods Bane and Cyric. 

At its height, the legendary wizards Manshoon and Fzoul Chembryl, along with their tyrannical warlord Paraghost ruling from the Darkhold, spread their influence across all of Faerun and challenged both Waterdeep in the west and even Thay in the east. All three of these villains will be among your ranks at the start of the game. 

Look to consolidate the Moonsea and backstab your lackey Galauntar Hawkhelm who believes he rules the region from the Citadel of the Raven just west of your capital. Pools of Radiance are scattered throughout the Moonsea Region, echoes of the lost greatness of the Elves who once ruled from Myth Drannor. And don't lose sight of your holdings in the Anauroch Desert, the highways across the wastes make for excellent profit and you already have a foothold."
#summary "Heavy infantry with high morale are expensive, so take production scales. Luckily you can recruit them anywhere outside your cap as well as in. Your magic is primarily Death, Blood, and Earth with some Astral and Fire. You have very strong priests. Luck scales will bring some amazing heroes your way."

#name "Kingdom of Calimshan"
#epithet "Lands of Intrigue"
#idealcold -1
#brief "The history of the Calishites led them to have deeply rooted ties to the genies that had long since left the lands. The blood of these beings was said to still flow strongly among the Calishites, which sometimes manifested among them as exceptional skill in the arcane arts. Genasi comprised around half of the area's population, either enslaved or free. Magic users were highly held with Calimshan society and would often be sought after as teachers."
#descr "Status was measured not in wealth in and of itself but in the ability to live comfortably with that wealth. The class system of Calimshan often confined its citizens to the station they were born into. Women were not seen as equals except in underworld trade. Calishites of lower class in the society would often take up adventuring as a way to amass fortune.

The government of Calimshan was composed of a hierarchical government. The largest of these governments was located in Calimport the capital and ruled by a Pasha or Syl-pasha. However, a variety of powerful indivuals, such as military leaders and influential mages also oversaw legal proceedings and leadership. Major cities within Calimshan - Almraiven, Calimport, Keltar, Manshaka, Memnon, Teshburl, and Volothamp - also had high viziers in leadership roles.

In Calimshan, you will have access to dozens of priests and wizards of every faith and focus.  It is the pride of the Calishites that they welcome all the gods and tolerate all forms of magic. Such a free society, however, is not without its challenges, for powerful and greedy forces gather openly in Calimshan and use these freedoms for their own personal and divine gains."
#summary "All the paths of magic are openly practiced in Calimshan, and you have supreme access to the many faiths of Faerun. Don't get overwhelmed. Coastal provinces bring extra income. Mechants as well. Protect your capital and expand your overseas empire with lots of sailing commanders."

#name "Cormyr"
#epithet "Land of the Purple Dragon"
#idealcold 0
#brief "Cormyr is a land under threat. Skeptical of wizards due to recent events and generally frowning upon adventuring without an official license, you'll have to rely on your tough armies and weak enlisted wizards compared to other nations - but you do have strong priests."
#descr "As of 1372 DR, the country was under threat from all sides and struggling to hold onto order. Nobles bickered over land rights, Sembian merchants and a Cult of the Dragon cell tried to gain a trading foothold, and there was a Zhentarim presence. The city of Shade and the ruins of Myth Drannor both posed a threat.

Around 1372 DR, the country felt the effects of the Goblin War as Nalavarauthatoryl, the Devil Dragon, returned from the shadow demiplane of Grodd in which she'd been imprisoned nearly 1,000 years earlier. She had long held a blood fued with the ruling Obarskyr royal lineage of Cormyr, and King Azoun IV was forced to ride out to meet her. The cities of Arabel, Eveningstar, Tyrluk and settlements in the Stormhorns were all badly damaged in the conflict. Bandits inhabited the roads and orc and goblin armies inhabited the forests. 

Though Azoun would never learn it before his death at the Devil Dragon's hands, it was his closest advisor and Master of the Council of Mages, Vangerdahast, who was responsible for the reawakening of Nalavarauthatoryl."
#summary "You are a powerhouse, but to expand you'll first have to deal with the Goblin Wars. Nearby provinces are overrun with powerful enemies, especially Eastern Cormyr to your east, where the Devil Dragon has taken up residence. You have excellent infantry and cavalry. The War College provides outstanding mages and clerics are common in nearby important cities. You'll also have flying cavalry and the famous Purple Dragon Knights to lean on."

#brief "Deep in the frozen mountains west of Anauroch lies a latent power needing only the slightest spark to ignite. Here, in the region known as the Spine of the World, the Kingdom of Many-Arrows is about to erupt."
#descr "Prior to the founding of the Kingdom, the Many-Arrows tribe was known as the largest, most notorious, and most successful orc tribe in the North, boasting about 40,000 members as of the mid–14th century DR. They operated out of the Citadel of Many Arrows until they were ousted in the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR, at which point they moved west to Dark Arrow Keep, which they claimed from its giant inhabitants. Although their numbers were decimated, they began waging war with Mithral Hall within three years and were widely expected to raise a horde and launch an invasion of the whole Silver Marches.

Expect to snowball early and wreak absolute havoc on the land with pop-killing troops and many that cause unrest. Use raiding and pillaging to your advantage to limiit your neighbors gains should they expand into your territory."
#summary "Orcs and goblins, trolls and giants, drow and dragons. Welcome to monster-ville.

However, you have some of the most versatile and dramatically powerful units in the game, including giants. You also have access to mobile gods, which most other nations do not have."

#descr "Like the Kingdom of Many-Arrows, the Savage Frontier is a loose confederation of warring monstrous tribes and clans. You can wreak absolute havoc on your neighbors with pillaging and raiding aplenty, but your economy will suffer as you expand. 

Your home base is in the Greypeak Mountains, a rugged and desolate mountain range in the eastern end of the Savage Frontier. You also have holdings in the Underdark just below - a place known as the Gauthgrottoes. 

Your perilous peaks and caverns were famous for being exceptionally hard to traverse, home to many fearsome beasts, monstrous humanoids, and even aberrant beings that inspired terror in wary travelers. For all their dangers, the Greypeaks houses incredible deposits of mineral wealth."

#summary "Though you have some of the most versatile and dramatically powerful units in the game, you have terribly weak research and very poor forts. You will begin the game with a Cloud Giant, his Stone Giant lackeys, and an adult red dragon. Expansion should be comfortable, but keeping your gains over time will be a terrific challenge."

#brief "This is one of the Heroic Nations, featuring poor native troops but excellent commanders and spellcasters."
#descr "Chult was located at the westernmost end of the Chultan peninsula, in the southern part of the Trackless Sea, off the coast of Calimshan. Chult has always been remote and isolated, forming a mountainous jungle of savage beasts, hulking dinosaurs, and disease-ridden swamps. Human tribes, goblins, and even stranger monstrous folk haunted the thick jungles. Nevertheless, Chult drew adventurers who sought its legendary riches. The primordial Ubtao was almost exclusively revered in the land, for the divine powers of Faerûn awarded Ubtao the dominion over the land of Chult in exchange for the deity's vigilance over the threat of Dendar the Night Serpent who is imprisoned beneath the Peaks of Flame.

An excellent single-player experience, the jungles are full of mystery and danger, including not only Dendar in The Peaks of Flame, but also the Tomb of Horrors - long considered the most unfairly dangerous dungeon in all of tabletop adventuring. Enjoy."

#summary "Races: Tabaxi tribesmen, Velociraptors from the amphitheater, and whatever else is out there in the nearby jungles.
Military: Weak. Poor troops overall.  
Magic: Strong. Some outstanding spellcasters and solid with research.
Priests: Strong. Every native caster is sacred and you have a rare sacred troop type as well.
Mechanics: Your expansion is severely limited on the Faerun map as nearby independents are VERY powerful. Protect yourself and take Port Nyanzaru as soon as possible."

#name "The Shaar"
#epithet "The Savage Plains"
#idealcold -1
#brief "This is one of the Savage Nations, focused on recruitable monsters and a roster that is highly dependent on nearby magic sites and terrains."
#descr "The vast expanse known as the Shar stretches like a thin, bloody and rugged ribbon across the entire southern continent. Throughout recorded history, it remained largely without civilization. 

Its heartland is nhabited by varied and warlike nomadic tribes - mainly of humans, centaurs, minotaurs, thri-kreen, and the lion-bodied wemics. They hunt the herd animals and regularly argue over water rights. Fearsome dire horses were known to roam the wilderness, inspiring fear, awe, folk tales, and even cultist veneration. Dragons, gnolls, manticores, hill giants and harpies also challenged the nomads for control. Occasionally, so-called 'civilized nations' laid claim to some parts of the Shaar or established settlements to aid in their trade of baubles - but only the ruins of these survive. 

You begin on two fronts - in the western heartlands, a tribe of Wemics under the just and savage rule of Shaq'ar is under your command, and you are primed for a rapid expansion. In the east, Xavarathimius, the Everlasting Wyrm, has reawakened, prapared to finally see his machinations to dominate all of the Shining South come to fruition. 

In addition to dominating the tall-grass prairies and forested foothills of the Shar, you'll need to win the support of the demon-worshipping Yuan-Ti and the noble and elusive Rakshasa. The latter are common among the larger settlements both on the western coasts of Lapaliiya and in the eastern free cities in Estagund and Durpar. Without them, you'll have little hope of keeping up, both magically as well as economically."
#summary "Wemics, Centaurs, and Thri-kreen will be common in your armies - fast and hard-hitting but with little armor. Gnolls, minotaurs, scrags, manticores and other various beasts will round out your armies with incredible raiding and pillaging potential. Various terrains offer additional troop types, and you'll appreciate the variety, but research will always be a concern until the Yuan-ti and Rakshasa can be recruited to your cause."

#name "Halruaa"
#epithet "Land of Magic"
#brief "Halruaa was a land of magic, renowned for its electrum mines and its Haerlu wine. The fabled, quiet and wealthy magocracy was justly depicted as full of wonder. Created by archwizards foreseeing the fall of Netheril, Halruaa combined peace and harmony with the magic powers of their ancestors, but without the taint of their ambitions."
#descr "Halruaans congregated in numerous villages and cities scattered throughout the country's interior. Most were small settlements with no more than a few hundred inhabitants each, while the largest settlements were smaller than the cities of most other nations. The folk of the small villages usually relied on a venerated wizard to provide both protection and leadership, while likely also serving as mayor and a member of the Council of Elders, the ruling body of the country. The leader of the council was the Netyarch, or wizard-king.

With natural fortifications and the leadership of a score of diviners, Halruaans lived in a near-perfect haven. They rarely felt the necessity to travel except when they needed to get new magic items or spell components, as nowhere else in Faerûn would they felt comfortably than home. Because usually most Halruaan travelers were wizards, most people across Faerûn had the wrong belief that all Halruaans were wizards.

Life in the cities of Halruaa was touched by magic in many ways. Their houses had at least a few built-in magical enhancements, such as magical street lamps, while a favorite practice in cities along the coast was to produce walls of magically coaxed coral, via the coral growth spell. Spells that produced sparkling lights and pleasing sounds were often woven into fine fabrics to enhance their beauty. Fanciful means of travel, such as carpets of flying or skyships, were commonplace. Everywhere in Halruaa, people took great pains to show off their abilities as well as their wealth." 
#summary "Races: Entirely human with some additions from nearby sites when playing on the Faerun scenario map. 
Military: Simple but effective infantry, fast light cav.  
Magic: Competing with Thay for the best wizards in the game. 
Priests: Only worshippers of Mystra and Azuth are permitted in Halruaa.
Mechanics:  Magehounds make excellent patrollers. Jordain Viziers are outstanding bodyguards. Both are highly magic resistant. Winged monkeys wreak havoc and are good fun."

#era 2 		
#name "Thay"
#epithet "The Red Wizards"
#brief "Thay was a mysterious and terribly powerful magocratic nation in east Faerûn, that was long-governed by the Zulkirs of the Red Wizards. It is ruled by the necromancer lich, Szass Tam, along with his Council of Zulkirs and a near-endless chain of bureaucrats and local tharchion knights. The true nature of Thay lies in the endless pursuit of arcane knowledge and power."
#descr "For most of Thay's history, the country operated under a strict social hierarchy. The Red Wizards were considered the upper echelon of Thayan society, a magocratic noble class that was followed by Mulan bureaucrats, priests, merchants, soldiers, and mixed Mulan-Rashemi artisans and craftspeople. Semi-skilled workers and common laborers were a mere step above the nation's great many slaves of nearly every race, that had been accumulated from across the Realms.

In the years following Szass Tam's seizure of power in 1385 DR, the Thayan people led hard, destitute lives. It was a land whose governing philosophy held that undeath was a preferred state of being for its people, full of boundless possibilities and immeasurable power. During most of the 15th century the living had no means to achieve prominence within Thay, as their mere existence was an affront to the beliefs of the High Regent.

To briefly escape the misery of life in the city, many Thayans sought more brutal forms of entertainment. Gladiatorial matches were common in larger cities like Eltabbar and Surthay, perhaps the only events that allowed commoners to succumb to their primal nature without fear of retribution from the upper class. The more ferocious and deadly combatants were celebrated by the throngs of spectators. The brutal gladiators from Thay were considered the finest and most savage in all the Realms."

#name "Unther"
#epithet "Realm of the God-King"
#brief "Unther was one of the Old Empires in east Faerûn. The Untherans were brought to Toril from Earth by the Imaskar Empire looking for some manpower. After countless petitions, the gods of the Untheric pantheon were able to manifest into Toril by sending physical avatars. With the help of their deities, the former slaves freed themselves and settled the lands that later became Unther. Ironically, their rival in the millennia to come was another human tribe captured by the Imaskari and freed at the same time, which founded the empire of Mulhorand."
#descr "The populace of Unther before 1358 DR was primarily composed of humans of the Mulan ethnic group, with a few humans of other ethnic groups as a minority. A few demihumans were also part of the Untheran populace, but only as slaves.

Members of Unther's nobility took up positions in the nation's government, often as priests, wizards, or bureaucrats. They were either Gilgeam's priests or his most trusted non-cleric followers. All nobles of Unther were of the Mulan ethnic group and they practiced marriage between members of the same family to maintain the purity of their Mulan bloodlines. Despite Unther's long history, its nobles were rather few in number. During Gilgeam's milennia-long rule, families fell from his favor and were sold to slavery, and he elevated a few 'pure-blooded Mulans' to replace them.

Finally, slaves in Unther were either members of those families who fell from Gilgeam's favor, or members of demihuman races. Their lives were worthless in the eyes of those in power. The only way to redeem oneself if born or lost into slavery was through the act of war.

Gilgeam's tyrannical rule has fostered a fierce but poorly organized resistance movement that has taken up hold across the empire. You'll need to bring these various factions to heel before you can press them into service, including priestesses of Ishtar, Cultists of Tiamat, and the wizard orders in Messemprar and the Greenfields."
#summary "Your troops are entirely made up of slaves, but very special ones - they level up over time, eventually becoming sacred. Keeping your forces alive will be a vital strategy. Your priests and wizards are fairly strong and most are sacred. What you lack in standard recruitment variety, you'll make up for with options from nearby magic sites in Shussel, Messemprar, and others."

#name "Mulhorand"
#epithet "The Ascendant Pharoahs"
#brief "In response to a plague that killed much of the ancient Imaskar Empire some 3,000 years ago, the Imaskari opened portals to another world in search of slaves. They found them in bronze-age Mesopotamia, on Earth. More than 100,000 people were brought through the portals, and then the portals were closed and all connections between the two worlds were sealed. The Imaskari called their new slaves 'the Mulan.'"

#descr "The Imaskari barrier inhibited contact between the Mulan and their own deities on Earth with whom they had a powerful and devout connection. Ao thus intervened and allowed mortal manifestations of these deities to bypass the barrier and enter Toril directly. These Egyptian and Sumerian deities battled the Imaskari, eventually defeating them in the year −2488 DR. Unable to return to their homes in the Outer Planes, these divine manifestations settled in and founded the nations of Mulhorand in −2135 DR and Unther in −2087 DR.Mulhorand expanded rapidly. The physical manifestations of the Mulhorandi/Kemetic gods ruled directly over their empire for the next 1000 years. At Mulhorand's peak, it stretched over much of eastern Faerun. Then came the Orcgate Wars. 

Some men just want to watch the world burn, and a man named Thayd was one such man. He dove deep into lost secretes of the Imaskari sorcerers to find a way to bring Mulhorand and Unther to their knees. His plot to overthrow and rule both empires failed, but he did manage to open several gates to a world inhabited by gray orcs. Neither Mulhorand nor Unther ever found them all, but the orcs sure did. The war lasted only 7 years and saw the deaths of several gods of the Mulan at the hands of Gruumsh. An alliance between the Mulhorandi and Untheric deities eventually turned the tide but neither Mulhorand nor Unther were able to ever fully recover. 

A divine manifestation of Horus-Re rules the nation in truth, but it is the clergy who orchestrate and administer the state. There are several other deities who maintain a divine presence in the lands of Mulhorand as well: Anhur, god of war, Set, god of destruction, Isis, goddess of life, and Thoth, god of knowledge. Each has their own temple and while they are technically part of the Mulhorandi nation and are willing to defend it, these deities have their own agendas and are not under your direct control."
#summary "As a theocratic nation, your various priests and theurgists are your greatest asset. Slaves make up the majority of the population and the poorly equipped but inexpensive soldiery. You have good commanders capable of improving their morale and all promote with XP, some eventually to sacreds. You also have the divine avatars of your gods, though all are immobile except Horus-Re. You will not struggle for magical research, and you are an astral powerhouse."

#name "Chessenta"
#epithet "Heroic Confederacy"
#brief "Chessenta was a confederation of city-states bound by common culture and mutual defense, but for most of its history wasn’t truly a unified nation and the Chessentan cities were often at war with one another. Chessenta was one of the so-called Old Empires of Faerûn."

#descr "In 929 DR the city states of Chessenta, led by the war hero Tchazzar, drove the armies of Unther to the Riders to the Sky mountains, freeing Chessenta from Untheric rule. During Tchazzar's brief Chessentan Empire, the city of Cimbar was the capital. In 1018 DR, Tchazzar disappeared while fighting sahuagin and the people of Chessenta believed he had ascended to godhood. After Tchazzar's disappearance, the kingdom slowly broke apart into squabbling city states. To this day, these city-states do not accept a central governing body or ruler. The rulers of Cimbar, Akanax, and Mordulkin all claim to be the true Overlord of Chessenta and add this to their other titles. Such claims are meaningless, however. There are no regional divisions as city governments simply claim as much territory as they can reasonably govern and where territorial claims clash, there is frequently war. 

The Chessentans themselves were a passionate people, always living to the fullest and never doing things half-way. Seen by outsiders as a drunken and riotous people, Chessentans had a well-earned reputation as fierce warriors and cunning tacticians. While they appreciated the fine arts and theatre, the culture of the Chessentans revolved around war and war heroes. Few nations in all Faerûn were as erudite in philosophy, astronomy, poetry, and history as Chessenta. Theatres and libraries were commonplace, and even in smaller cities such poetry and philosophy were practiced in public squares. Chessentans also loved sports and their athletic competitions were popular events, particularly wrestling, and almost every citizen had some skill at fighting. Chessenta’s sizable middle class controlled the country’s economy, with a government that encouraged prosperity for all, so tax revenues were high. 

Tchazzar returned in 1373 DR to reestablish his kingdom. 
"

#summary "Tchazzar is not who the people believe him to be. He is, in fact, a dragon in disguise. And not just any dragon - he contains one of the three shards of Tiamat's soul which were split apart when Gilgeam, God-King of nearby rival Unther, slew the Goddess of Dragons. Tzchazzar is your greatest asset. Beyond his power, you will come to rely on your excellent soldiers - though they are few in number they are elite. You also have an excellent variety of spellcasting and melee commanders which you can put into small teams of adventurers and wreak havoc behind enemy lines. Like all Heroic Confederacies, your economy is vital to your success."

#name "Aglarond"
#epithet "Magocracy of the Simbul"
#brief "Aglarond was a magocratic state in the southwestern-most part of the Unapproachable East with its capital at Veltalar. Most of its land was covered by the Yuirwood. Filled with magic and mystery, it was ruled by one of the most potent spellcasters of the Realms: the Simbul."

#descr "Aglarond was a magocratic state in the southwestern-most part of the Unapproachable East with its capital at Veltalar. Most of its land was covered by the Yuirwood. Filled with magic and mystery, it was ruled by one of the most potent spellcasters of the Realms: the Simbul. As of 1372 DR, Aglarond's population, numbering somewhere around 1.3 million, was made up of mainly humans and half-elves. Aglarond was the only known state in Faerûn to possess a demographically significant half-elven population. Aglarond also had a traditional rivalry with their neighbors in Thay, whom Aglarondans distrusted deeply. 

There were few temples and holy sites in Aglarond, none of which were large. Some people worshiped regularly and others were content to show signs of faith in their own manner. Chauntea, Valkur, and Selune were the most widely venerated with the Seldarine pantheon enjoying a small number of prayers as well. 

The native, Yuir wild-elves had their own pantheon of gods that disappeared with the downfall of their culture. They had suffered significant wars with the drow, satyrs, and mountain trolls before the arrival of humans on the peninsula around 750 DR. The human settlers, mainly retired soldiers and peniless mercenaries from Unther and Chessenta, agreed to help the wild elves and together they succeeded in defeating the drow. Many half-elven babies were born in the years to come. The few Yuir wild elves who remain live deep in the Yuirwood and are rarely seen.

In 1320 DR, the half elven dynasty that had reigned since the nation's founding came to an end and the Queen named The Simbul as her heir. As one of the Seven Sisters and a Chosen of Mystra, the Simbul has reigned as an immortal Queen for more than a century."
#summary "Some believe The Simbul is as powerful as Elminster, who happens also to be her lover. Indeed, she is your greatest asset and immortal so long as she remains in your dominion. Her apprentices, the Simbarchs, are numerous and extremely powerful in their own right. Magic is otherwise quite rare in Aglarond and most of your troops will be of high quality but expensive. You have a portal to the Forest of Leth to your north, where your allies fight for the survival of the Great Dale against abyssal and dark druidic forces."

#name "Impiltur"
#epithet "Realm of the Sword and Wand"
#brief "Impiltur (pronounced: IM-pil-tur) was a wealthy and influential nation of feudal lords nestled along the coastal lands of the Easting Reach, in northeastern Faerûn. It had a long and storied history within the eastern realms and its reputation grew and declined throughout the ages. The formerly influential kingdom endured decades of isolation and, while it was not without its share of troubles, emerged as a land that remained hopeful about reclaiming its former glory."
#descr "The society of Impiltur was formed around the tenets of the Triad—the collective faiths of Ilmater, Torm and Tyr. This religion placed the expectation of devotion, service and sacrifice upon the Impilturan people, a concept that was exemplified in the realm's culture of piety. In addition, the worship and veneration of saints and divine martyrs was considered a cornerstone of the Triadic faith.

Despite its national religion, Impiltur maintained a liberal and welcoming attitude to the faithful of benevolent deities. Followers of Chauntea, Tymora, Selûne and Waukeen were quite numerous throughout the realm. The formation of shrines and temples dedicated to malevolent gods, such as Bane and Cyric, was explicitly illegal; however, private worship of their faiths were somewhat tolerated. No such refuge was given to the myriad of demonic cults that sporadically arose throughout Impiltur's countryside. The fanatical who worshiped ancient Narfell and the Demon princes were slain on sight and their vile altars were brought to justice. The taint of fiend-worship has plagued Impiltur for centuries

Practitioners of the Arcane Arts were commonly found in Impiltur. The nation featured two magical academies. Apprentices went on to serve aboard merchant ships operated by the nation's trade consortiums who provided funding for the academies. The wizards themselves were required to serve for one year and were well-compensated for their efforts."
#summary "This can be a very tough nation to succeed with, given your extremely dangerous neighbors, including the agressive demon-lords of Narfell. Good luck!"

#epithet "Confederation of Luruar"
#brief "Luruar, also commonly known as the Silver Marches, was a confederation of cities in the north of Faerûn, under the leadership of Alustriel Silverhand, former ruler of Silverymoon. It consisted of Silverymoon, Citadel Adbar, Deadsnows, Jalanthar, Quaervarr, Citadel Felbarr, Everlund, Mithral Hall, and Sundabar, and its goal was to protect the North against the growing horde of orcs in the mountains."
#descr "Luruar, also commonly known as the Silver Marches, was a confederation of cities in the north of Faerûn, under the leadership of Alustriel Silverhand, ruler of Silverymoon. The years 1368 through 1370 DR were particularly turbulent for the city-states of the North. Troll attacks, orc hordes, a combined army of demons and barbarians, and a string of particularly harsh winters spurred the regional city-states into the confederation. Members included Silverymoon, Citadel Adbar, Deadsnows, Jalanthar, Quaervarr, Citadel Felbarr, Everlund, Mithral Hall, and Sundabar. 

Bordered by the Anauroch desert to the east, the High Forest to the south, the Savage Frontier to the west and the Spine of the World mountain range to the north, it was surrounded by savage frontier. The Silver Marches' first line of defense often came in the form of information. Many small groups of city-sponsored scouts, bands of rangers, adventuring companies, independent cells of Harpers, and others scouted the stretches of Wilderness that often presented threats to the civilized lands. Smaller towns trained their own local patrols. Each of the cities maintained their own, large armed forces, which combined often into the collective 'Argent Legion' for large-scale operations."
#summary "You have outstanding scouts, rangers, clerics, and spellcasters. You have excellent stealth and patrol with strong units that can raid unseen and cause havoc behind enemy lines. Nothing you have is cheap, however. Lady Alustriel is powerful, and a Chosen of Mystra, giving her dominion immortality. You'll need every ounce of defense against your inevitably agressive neighbors."

#brief "Amn , also known as the Merchant's Domain, was a tremendously wealthy nation in West Faerûn. Amn held colonies far away in Maztica and controlled important trade routes to Calimshan and Baldur's Gate as well as colonial ports in the Moonshaes and Chult. "
#descr "Amn's population was mostly human with a large minority population of halflings. The country's natural resources and wealth, combined with its mercantile nature, led Amn to become one of the most important and influential trading centers throughout Faerûn. The crowning jewel of this powerful state was the capital city of Athkatla, often called the 'City of Coin.'

Amn was ruled by the Council of Six, organized by the secretive wizard Thayze Selemchant. The anonymous Councilmemebers oversaw all trade and military movements of the nation, and upheld the law restricting the use of magic in the realm. Only those wizards who had the patronage of one of the Council of Six, could practice their art. 

Divine magic, however, had no such restrictions. Waukeen was the premier deity and enjoyed many temples throughout the nation. Chauntea, Selune, Helm and Ilmater also enjoyed more limited patronage. However, amongst these deities of harmony, Cyric, Bane, Myrkul, and Bhaal also had numerous followers in Amn, particularly among the Shadow Thieves."
#summary "You have outstanding spies and assassins, spellcasters who are unaffected by Magical Drain scales, and a competent military. Sailing is a key feature of your commanders as well. Your far flung colonial holdings will bring you into conflict with many rivals. Will your powerful economy be enough to maintain it? Both Luskan in the northwest and part of the lucrative Moonshae Isles to your due west are in your possession. Expand wisely."

Despite its long-standing presence as a neutral power, the leaders of Baldur's Gate were members of the Lords' Alliance of powers in the west."
#descr "Baldur's Gate, also called simply the Gate, was the largest metropolis and city-state on the Sword Coast. It was a crowded city of commerce and opportunity, prosperity and influence.  Despite its long-standing presence as a neutral power, the leaders of Baldur's Gate were members of the Lords' Alliance along with Waterdeep and Silverymoon among others.

The strong peace-keeping force known as the Watch, along with the presence of the powerful Flaming Fists mercenary company, kept the city generally peaceful and safe. This inherent sense of security allowed the Gate to keep a tolerant and welcoming attitude towards outsiders, whether they were wealthy merchants, poor refugees or even less-scrupulous individuals such as pirates, thieves, and smugglers. These varying influences gave it the reputation of a viper's pit of schemes and schemers.

The Flaming Fists began operating in Baldur's Gate in the early 14th century DR. In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR, the Bhaalspawn Sarevok Anchev orchestrated a major conspiracy to send the city to war with Amn. The plan failed and within two years all Bhaalspawn were killed due to the actions of the future Grand Duke, Abdel Adrian."
#summary "You have broad access to many clerics in the capital, including fortune-telling Tymorans to help foresee bad events. 
Your distinct lack of research mages means securing nearby Candlekeep will prove pivotal in the research game. 
Coastal provinces will yield a strong income, which you already have from the capital. More than gold, however, you'll need resources to field your heavily armored troops. Luckily, you have Merchant Lords to ease that pain. 
You have many powerful adversaries, especially nearby Amn and the monsters of the Savage Frontier. Waterdeep may pose a threat as well should they look to expand along the coast or unseat you from your interests in the Moonshae Isles."

Ancient, imperialist Nar culture was wholly ingrained with the practice of conjuring and bargaining fiends, as evidenced by the summoning chambers that have been found in each uncovered Nar fortress. Using mere glyphs and wards as their protection, Nar conjurers frequently opened portals to numerous layers of both the Abyss and the Nine Hells.

A new pact is now being forged. Warlocks arrive from across the realms, drawn to the region by its dark past and intent on reestablishing the infernal contracts that brought abyssal entities across the barrier.

#name "Cult of the Dragon"
#epithet "Wearers of Purple"
#brief "Easily the most powerful faction at the start of the game. Your holdings will be spread wide, with 6 isolated provinces under your control and full access to dragons. Their research and expansion will test you if they are left under AI control - don't let them snowball."

#descr "You have plenty of wizards and many locations throughout Faerun. Despite your lack of native troops, you do, however, have DRAGONS. And you can summon more through rituals. Care for your precious eggs until they mature. Research and cast Twiceborn on your mature and ancient dragons to make them into Dracoliches when they die. If you can hang on long enough, you will BATHE the world in your balefire. In the meantime, you will have a wide range of recruitable wizards at your disposal along with very cheap labs. On the flip side, note your very expensive temples. 

The Cult of the Dragon was also known as the Followers of the Scaly Way and the Wearers of Purple. They were a a semi-religious evil organization venerating undead dragons, or dracoliches, founded by Sammaster, a powerful wizard and former Chosen of Mystra. Their belief was that dracoliches were destined to one day rule Faerûn and beyond and that it was their purpose to help this come to pass. They were considered to be a secret society or a beast cult, albeit an overly large and powerful one, and also as a mercantile and criminal enterprise.

Although it was active all over Faerûn, particularly the Heartlands, the Cult of the Dragon was strongest in the North and the Cold Lands, where dragons were most common and most feared. In the mid–14th century DR, they were believed to have their base in the lands north of Thar, as this was the origin of the devastating Flight of Dragons in 1356 DR. In fact, they had no primary base or headquarters as of around 1370 DR. But later, circa 1372 DR, fresh rumors spoke of a secret fortress or headquarters somewhere near the Battle of Bones in the Western Heartlands — and they spoke true, alluding to the citadel under construction over the Well of Dragons. This was to be their new headquarters."

#summary "Probably not balanced, but fun nonetheless. You will begin with 6 provinces spread around the continent. Use the 'n' hotkey to find units lacking orders, for sure. Not your cheap labs and extremely expensive temples."

#selectnation 221
#era 2
#name "Kingdom of Corwell"
#epithet "Lords of the Moonshae Isles"
#brief "Corwell was the first and oldest kingdom of the Ffolk within the Moonshaes Isles. It was founded by the hero Cymrych Hugh, who later became the first High King and moved his capital to Callidyrr."

#descr "Corwell was the first and oldest human kingdom within the Moonshaes Isles located west of the Sword Coast and for a time, unified the major islands of Alaron and Gwynneth as well as the patchwork of smaller islands and archipelagos. The population was diverse, though dominated by humans who identified themselves ethnically as 'the Ffolk.' Halflings, dwarves, and elves were common in the Moonshaes, as were giants, fomorians, and their reclusive firbolg kin. Northlander reavers with ancestral ties to Luskan dominated the smaller islands and made constant raids on the more peaceful ffolk. On the island of Gwynneth sat the capital, Caer Corwell as well as Myrloch Vale, an important site for druids and fey that would later come to be the epicenter of major conflicts. 

In 1345, Corwell was invaded by a an alliance of giants and northlanders in a conflict known as the Darkwalker Wars. The gods Bhaal and Malar hoped to unseat Chauntea, the Earthmother, from her dominion over the isles. Corwell stood no match for the invaders until the heroic Prince Tristan of House Kendrick and his lover, Robyn, the High Druid of Myrloch Vale, led a counterattack into the heart of the enemy and killed Kazgaroth, an avatar of Malar. Tristan was named High King and briefly united the Moonshaes under his banner. 

Recent events, however, have seen the kingdom fall apart once again. At Myrloch Vale, an ancient city of elves has risen up from the waters through a portal to the Feywild. A Fey Queen, Ordalf, has claimed dominion over the whole of the Island. The Earthmother is silent and the Druids of the Vale have been turned to stone. All human inhabitants of Gwynedd have been banished - including those in the former capital city of Caer Corwell. Pushed back to the pallisades of Caer Callidyr to regroup, King Tristan is joined by his wife, Queen Robyn and their two daughters, unsure of the future."  

#summary "The setting and characters of the very first Forgotten Realms novels and adventure packs makes their mod debut. Your goal, to re-unite the Moonshaes, will test you. Tough indies, foreign powers, reawakening threats, and internal divisions will require skill and luck to navigate. 
Notable Units: Sacred Elven Cav, excellent nature access via your druids, strong heroes to start the game, a legendary sword to call your own, several national spells and summons."

#name "Menzoberranzan"
#epithet "Realm of the Spider Queen"
#brief "Menzoberranzan, the City of Spiders, was a large underground drow city-state in the Upper Northdark. Menzoberranzan was possibly the most well known drow city in Faerûn. Located in the Upper Northdark, about 2 miles below the Surbrin Valley. It was quite close to Mithral Hall and was connected through tunnels to that and many other locations."

#descr "Menzoberranzan was located in a huge arrowhead-shaped cavern, some two miles wide and a thousand feet high. The city was mainly carved from calcite and it was filled with blue, green, and violet faerie fire. Buildings were often covered with the city's main motif: the spider, in honor of Lolth. A powerful priestess named Menzoberra led seven drow families at Llolth's request into the Northdark in -3917 DR from the southerly drow holdings of Great Bhaerynden. Their goal was to escape from the constant warring between factions who venerated Lolth and those that worshiped Ghaunadaur, The Lord of Slimes. 

The original seven drow families, having no immediate external enemy, fell to attacking and undermining one another——exactly what they had hoped to escape—to the greater glory of their evil goddess, who loved such chaos. The result was an exodus of the losing noble families from the city and the spreading of dark elves across the Northdark. 

The city had many different factions, or Houses, all of which vied for power. As it was a matriarchal society, however, only females truly held power. Officially, the city was under the rule of the Ruling Council of Eight, composed of the eight matron mothers of the first (and most powerful) eight houses. For many centuries—as long as any living drow could remember—it was under the indirect rule of House Baenre, which had ruled for centuries uncontested.

The worship of any other deity but Llolth was forbidden, though a few secret cults to Vhaeraun persisted.

The city is split into four provices, over which your house will rule from just one. You'll need to unify all of Menzoberranzan to stand a chance against your many enemies nearby, which include the brutish orcs of the Frozen Spine, the Duergar of Gracklstugh who have not yet learned their place, and the Dwarves of the Silver Marches, intent to reclaim the Northkingdom's former glory."  
#summary "You have powerful priestesses and capable mages, tough mounted troops and sacred commanders. Perhaps deadliest will be your crusading Handmaidens of the Spider Queen - crusaders to inspire your armies to glory. Fill your front lines with slaves and claim the Underdark in the name of the Queen of the Demonweb Pits."

#epithet "Vrael Olo of the Yuan-ti"
#brief "The ancient Sarrukh empire of Mhairshaulk once held dominion across all of Faerun. Their breeding experiments led to many of the beings we know today - troglodytes, lizardfolk, and their vrael olo - their favored ones - the corrupt and degenerate Yuan-ti."

#descr "Long before humankind dominated the continent of Faerûn, the Creator Races ruled Toril. The reptilian Creator Race - the Sarrukh - were foremost amongst them. They built vast empires that stretched across Faerun and the throughout the planes. Their reign lasted more than 30,000 years. 

The Sarrukh eventually fell from power around the time of the collapse of the human empire of Netheril as their deity, Sseth, sank into somnolence. The Sarrukh, long suffering from endless war throughout the planes, sunk also into hibernation deep in their ruins. Their children, the Yuan-ti, assumed their creators' mantle, but with Sseth not answering prayers, they sought aid from other gods. Some bargained with the Mulhorandi deity Set, some with Moander, and others with the maddening denizens of the demonic Abyss.

Merrshaulk was the name given to Sseth's physical manifestation, which could still be called upon, even if Sseth did not answer prayers. Summoning this aspect became the central goal of Yuan-ti worship. 

Whenever possible, yuan-ti choose manipulation over open confrontation, the whisper over the fang. Followers of the Sacred Way of Sseth know their foes, think ahead, and plan forward. Counting decades as mere days, they play the long game. Yuan-ti culture centers around its temples, its breeding experiments, and its bloody sacrifices. Their lairs, hidden deep in ancient ruins within the underdark, are impenetrable."  

#summary "The Yuan-ti are exceptionally powerful mages. Lizardfolk and troglodytes make squishy but numerous troops capable of operating both on the surface as well as within the underdark. Your location within the Serpent Deeps of the Mhair Jungles puts you in a secluded and safe position to expand your power in any direction you wish. Your ability to breed sea serpents will help you dominate the Shining Sea."

#name "Sloopdilmonpolop"
#epithet "Free City of the Kuo-Toa"
#brief "Sloopdilmonpolop, the City of Pools, was a city of the kuo-toa in the middle Old Shanatar domain of the Underdark."

#descr "Kuo-toa societies were oppressive feudal theocracies and their priests exercised complete control over the citizens' lives. Common kuo-toa performed menial labor, such as fishing, farming, or guard duty, although without supervision by a whip or monitor they would normally flee dangerous combat situations. 

The ruling archpriests of a kuo-toa community decided which gods the lower kuo-toa had to exclusively worship some of which were imagined by the priests themselves. Kuo-toa might also revere krakens, aboleths, morkoths, and other eldritch horrors, with their madness having blinded them to their manipulation by said entities Some tribes followed more conventionally divine entities, including the slimy and eldritch Moander, tyrannical Bane, or the mistress of darkness Shar. 

Circa −3000 DR, Sloopdilmonpolop was founded by Sloopdilmonpol, a great kuo-toa prophet, as a temple-city in the Underdark off the coast of Tethyr. Eventually the temple grew into a theocratic city-state, with priest-king rulers.

After an increasing number of expansionist raids by the city's denizens, the dwarves of Sondarr and Xothaerin dispatched scouts who eventually discovered the City of Pools. This touched off a centuries-long war of mutual extinction, known as the Axe and Fin Wars. The city was never taken. It has since become a somewhat welcoming trade hub within the underdark, though illithids are never welcome. 

Sloopdilmonpolop was recently flooded by kuo-toan refugees fleeing the Abolethic Sovereignty within the Glimmersea. This has only added to its position as a power within the middledark that even the drow of nearby Guallidurth have come to respect."
#summary "Sloopdilmonpolop is in a great location for expasion without underwater competitors nearby. They have solid priest-mages and cheap sacred troops and a high pretender dominion will help you utilize them. The Underdark is a dangerous place though, so long-term strategies may require foreign recruits, no doubt driven mad by Blibdoolpoolp and her brubbling faithful."

#brief "Far below the Sea of Fallen stars lies an ocean in Lowerdark known as the Glimmersea. Here, in these dread waters, the Aboleths plot their schemes of opening the void gates and spreading their dominion across all of Faerun."

#descr "Aboleth cities were vast affairs of bizarre and alien architecture, located deep underwater. The Shape of Water, located in the Underdark's Glimmersea, was a notable aboleth fortified settlement.

Like most aberrant creatures, aboleths were originally from the Far Realm, though long ago many of them emigrated from the distant plane to the Prime Material Plane, where they settled in the Underdark. There, the vast majority of Toril's aboleths dwelled, though they could be found elsewhere, most commonly haunting ruins, deep lakes, or old temples. In some of these places, the kuo-toa foolishly served them.

Aboleths originally came to Toril when the world was young. The ancient obelisk-shaped city of Xxiphu plummeted to the world and settled deep in the earth's crust, below what was later the Sea of Fallen Stars. The oldest known aboleth and possibly the progenitor of the entire species, the Eldest, was an enormous creature that rested atop the city like a throne.

Even the Elder Brains of the mind-flayers fear the Aboleths of the Deep, for these denizens plot their schemes neither in  decades nor centuries, but in millennia."

#brief "Oryndoll, the City of Loretakers, was a large underground mind flayer citystate in the Lowerdark of the Darklands. Oryndoll was one of the earliest illithid cities on Toril and was highly famed for its inhabitants rampant collection of exclusive knowledge. Its wealth of knowledge rivaled even Candlekeep's great library. "

#descr "The mere mention of Oryndoll struck fear into most Underdark denizens of southwestern Faerûn not only due to it being an illithid city, but also because it was a holy site of the deity Ilsensine - the god brain. The city was difficult to reach from other places in the Underdark because of its depth, and the mindflayers carefully guarded these secret passages.

In 1358 DR, during the Time of Troubles, Ilsensine adopted as its avatar the elder brain in Oryndoll, stimulating illithid society. The illithids created new technologies, new psionic items, and more psionic disciplines, as well as renewed their assaults on surface lore holdings. 

Oryndoll's main united purpose was to acquire knowledge no matter how trivial, through stripping it from the thrall races. The end goal of this was to reduce the rest of Toril to barbarism."

#name "Deep Shanatar"
#epithet "Last of the Mithral Kings"
#brief "Deep Shanatar was once a great underground realm of the mountain dwarves. It first came into being around −10,800 DR when a great migration from Bhaerynden arrived at the massive cavern complex beneath Tethyr, Amn, and Calimshan. While plagued by internal strife and external threats, it lasted more than 10,000 years." 

#descr "Sometime around −11,000 DR, Taark Shanat, a dwarven crusader, led a westbound mass exodus from the dwarven realm of Great Bhaerynden. This enormous migration eventually reached the Rift of Dhalnadar, where the dwarves encountered the cloakers and their dragon masters of Rringlor Noroth. A great conflict ensued, known as the Cloaker Wars. The dwarves eventually drove the cloakers back, while Taark Shanat and his eight sons personally killed the four great blue wyrms that had claimed the Rift as their own domain. The dragons' lair, a large, open-ended cavern overlooking Dhalnadar and all of Shanatar, was named Brightaxe Hall and became the seat of Taark Shanat's new kingdom, which he named Alatorin. The Wyrmskull Throne was fashioned from the skulls of the slain dragons and Taark Shanat's eight sons each went on to found their own, separate sub-kingdoms within Deep Shanatar. 

The realm underwent at least three great golden ages, surviving many internal wars and repelling countless invasions by drow, orcs, goblins and men. But it was not to last. An alliance of Drow, Cloakers, and the dwarves' mind-flayer-twisted brethren, the Duergar, destroyed Brightaxe Hall in the Third Spider-War and while the sub-kingdoms clung on to survival for a time, the region eventually fell into ruin and the majority of dwarves not killed or enslaved, fled north to Mithril Hall and the Northkingdom or else scattered among the surface realms. The last remaining home of the proud mountain dwarves is the city-state of Iltkazar.

Iltkazar has proven itself strong and resourceful as the last holdout of the once-great dwarven empire. More isolationist than their northern cousins, and more subtle than their kin to the south, Iltkazar stands as the last of the Mithril Kingdoms within the underdark."  

#summary "There are very few dwarves left in the realm of Shanatar and your position, at a great crossroads of the underdark, means you will likely face challengers early. The ruins of many great keeps lie to your north. Special sites abound there if you can take them. You have excellent and heavily armed soldiers at game start, and supporting troops from afar to help your ambitious goals. Promotable commanders, strong earth magic and clerics, and amazing citadels will all be needed. Note that you gain no foreign recruitment."

#brief "The massive Underdark city of Llurth Dreier lay beneath the Shaar. The lurking avatar of Ghaunadaur has recently be risen by his clergy and this manifestation demands sacrifice. The church of That Which Lurks maintains a presence in many secret places, including the Pit of Ghaunadaur beneath Waterdeep. Consolidate your borders and spread your abberant madness across all of Faerûn."

#descr "Llurth Dreier, known as the Accursed City and the City of Ooze, was a drow city in the Great Bhaerynden domain of the Underdark.  It was home to nearly 60,000 drow and more than 100,000 slaves. There were also uncounted jellies, oozes, and slimes which were revered and cultivated. It was perhaps the most populous drow city in all of Faerûn.

The drow Houses stayed safe inside their black towers, and offered a piffling degree of protection to those who offered them tribute. Their slaves, dwelling in abject misery, were otherwise almost completely ignored, left to fend for themselves and eke out a living. The black towers held some wealth, but all outside was utterly squalid. Unrestrained by any sense of shame or style, the nobles regularly raided the fields of rival Houses to steal food and kidnap people to serve as slaves or sacrifices to Ghaunadaur.

which tended to rear its head in cities marred by unrest where other rival deities, such as Lolth, were less powerful. One example of this was Eryndlyn, which was contested by adherents of the Elder Eye and various Dark Seldarine factions. "  

#summary "In addition to your capital in Bhaerynden, you have far-flung temples beneath Waterdeep, Baldur's Gate, and Thay. These all need reinforcement before they are discovered and rooted out by your rivals. Your income is awful, but you have access to vast numbers of troops which need little upkeep or feeding. Spread your fetid rule across the underdark and cover the thrones of ascension in your ooze. Slime for the slime god!"

#name "Gracklstugh"
#epithet "The City of Blades"
#brief "The City of Blades, Gracklstugh, was a duergar city on the shores of the Darklake in the Northdark. Located five miles beneath the Evermoors of the Dessarin River valley and the Uthgardt ancestor mound Flintrock, it was roughly 100 miles from Menzoberranzan across the Darklake and below." 
#descr "Gracklstugh was a cavern city that sloped down on the eastern side to join the Darklake as a subterranean port. The city was lit by the firelight of smelters and foundries mingling among stalagmites. The air smelled acrid and was filled with industrial sounds: fire, steam, and iron ringing. The persistent smog that filled the cavern could cause a persistent and sometimes fatal cough, known as grackle-lung.

It was founded in −3717 DR by duergar escaping the fall of Deep Shanatar and the subsequent enslavement of many gray dwarves in the mindflayer of Oryndoll. In 1372 DR, Deepking Horgar Steelshadow IV used the Silence of Lolth and the disarray of her followers as an excuse to attack the drow city of Menzoberranzan and thus cement his power over his lairds. Under his whip, Horgar led his army to success against the drow at the Pillars of Woe and gained additional allies, including the drow of Chaulssin and the infernal Scourged Legion of Kaanyr Vhok, lord of Hellgate Keep and the ruins of the Shield Dwarven realm of Ammarindar. 

In 1373 DR, the Silence of Lolth ended and Lolth's priestesses regained their powers. Kaanyr Vhok subsequently recalled his forces to Hellgate Keep and the remaining duergar and allied armies were easily defeated and turned back. As the Duergaar army retreated, Horgar was betrayed by his drow allies and killed, leaving the city vulnerable and the throne temporarily vacant. Regardless of their back-footed position, Gracklstugh possesses one of the strongest militaries in all the underdark and understand well their place as a prized ally and vital trade partner."  

#summary "You have excellent commanders, priests, and mages but they are resource and gold intensive. Your limited population will hamper your economy. You'll have no foreign recruits to help you, but you can take slaves to round out your armies and will find prized magic site recruit options if you can take the Northdark for yourself. Perhaps your greatest asset is your ability to craft magical items of great power, well above the limits of your arcane talents."

#descr "Deep Duerra's faithful dominated the Underspires, a region of the Darklands within the Middledark and the empire she built before being risen to godhood by the gray dwarven god Ladaguer. Two great Duergar cities - Dunspeirrin, the City of Sunken Spires, and Drik Hargunenand, the Iron Stair, were the core of what was the most sprawling Duergar realm in the Underdark and which claimed to have once razed Oryndoll, the center of Mindflayer power in Faerun. 

The empire fell into stagnation after Duerra's ascension and was beset on all sides by its innumerable enemies, falling back finally to the darklands. Despite its defeat and the loss of its vast holdings, The Underspires still maintains its unconquered core.

Around 1369 DR, the Underspires formed the Army of Steel and marched on an upstart alliance of shield and gold dwarves, who sought to reclaim their ancient kingdoms in Deep Shanatar. The War of Gold and Gloom ensued and would continue to the present day. Should the Duergar claim Old Shanatar for themselves, little could stop them from damming Moradin's River of Gold, the tangible link of the Dwarven god's influence on Faerun. Such a victory would ensure that The Underspires will once again spread their empire of the bloody axe across the whole of the underdark. 

This nation will play like your Duergar cousins in Gracklstugh for now, though unique astral and water mage units may be added to the roster in the future to represent Duerra's domains, gifts, and spheres of divine power."

#name "Auramycos"
#epithet "The Inexorable Growth"
#brief "Araumycos was a huge life form, a single organism that covered almost all the parts of the Underdark beneath the High Forest"
 
#descr "The dwarves of ancient Ammarindar told of how their mines located in the region beneath the High Forest were abandoned to the slow, inexorable growth of Araumycos - The Great Fungus. The elves had legends that dated back farther still, linking the birth of Araumycos to the fell sorceries of the Vyshaantar Empire, but so little was known of that era, even among the long memories of the elves, that no origin could be conclusively determined. Araumycos was thought by some to be the oldest living creature on Toril; even the gods did not speak of it, and divine divinations regarding the titanic fungus always failed. Some believed that the creature was an avatar of Psilofyr, the lord of the myconid, but this was only a theory.

The entire landscape was sentient. Referring to itself as 'King Araumycos', it brought millions of myconids under its domination, and tried to do the same with any sentient creature within hundreds of miles through strange nightmare-dreams (which the drow called golhyrrl' fhaazht or 'the Dream Trap') that spoke of the comfort of the mass and the hopeless chaos of individuality.

But, while the slow and nonviolent spread of Auramycos was counted in miles per milennia, a more sinister rot was emerging from the heart of The Great Fungus - the Lady of Rot and Decay, Zuggtmoy, the Demon Queen of Fungi had also awoken sometime around the mid 1300s DR. Her aims were malevolent and her ambitions were to spread her mycelial network across the whole of Faerun."  

#summary "This is a bizarre nation, perhaps best left in the hands of the ai. All of your myconid units suffer from homesickness, losing a percentage of their health each turn they spend away from the province from which they were born. You have no foreign recruitment, and very limited anywhere you have built a fort - not that your bramble forts are much worth building anyway. Your influence, however, extends well beyond Auramycos."

#name "Cairnheim"
#epithet "Realm of the Undead Giants"
#idealcold 0
#brief "Cairnheim was ruled by the Dodkong, or Deathking, and his council of Dodforerir, or 'Death Chiefs.' Both the king and the Dodforerir were all cairns, stone giant liches. Each of the Dodforerir were raised from the dead by the Dodkong through the unholy powers of The Crown of Obadai."
#descr "Being of the kingdoms that made up the ancient empires of Ostoria and Nedeheim, Cairnheim controlled the Giant's Run Mountains. Over the centuries, it carved great roads and stairs through its peaks, as well as tremendous halls within the Underdark.

It was one of the giant kingdoms that warred with the ancient dragon kingdoms during the Dawn Age and was also one of the few fragment kingdoms that survived past Ostoria's fall. It eventually came into a conflict with the dwarves of High Shanatar during their golden age. It fell apart around -5350 DR, disappearing into ruins but not fogotten by the giants who clung to survival in the surrounding landscape.

In -160 DR, a stone giant lich by the name of Grugaran came to the Giant's Run Mountains with the crown of Obadai, the legendary crown of Faerûn's first stone giant. Bolstered by its dark powers, Grugarin declared himself Dodkong. He gathered the stone giant clans together and bent them to his purpose. He called his new kingdom Cairnheim.

Over time the Dodkong's realm grew. Slowly at first, by 1372 DR it had a sizeable population. More than a dozen minor clanholds of stone giants and hill giants acknowledged the Dodkong as their ruler. Several large tribes of goblins and orcs rallied around Cairnheim when called upon, and nearby human communities offered him tribute. Around this time some communities within the Underdark began to fear that Cairnheim might be preparing themselves to expand beyond their borders, noting a growing number of undead giants roaming the mountains and carving tunnels through the upperdark."

#summary "The Dodkong himself is your most powerful asset. He bears the Crown of Obadai and with it has tremendous power over the undead. Twiceborned Stone Giants become Cairns, powerful liches capable of wreaking havoc and raising tremendous armies of the living dead. But not all of your assets are bones and the fettered dead. You can call on many other giants and monstrosities both on the surface and within the underdark."

#name "Maerimydra"
#epithet "The Silence of Llolth"
#brief "Maerimydra (pronounced MARE-uh-MID-ruh), the Burning City, was a large drow city located below the Dalelands in the Deep Wastes. It became a battleground between those loyal to Llolth and those drow gods who opposed the Spider Queen's continued domination of their people - namely Eilistraee, Vhaeraun, and Kiaransalee."

#descr "From its founding, sometime prior to -2600 DR, Maerimydra was a place of internal conflict between these forces. The city sat at the heart of a sprawling domain that expanded and collapsed numerous times due its internal rebellions. 

For a time, the drow of Maerimydra extended their borders all the way to the surface Realms Above. Shadowdale in fact draws its name from its long occupation by the drow of the Deep Wastes. Shadowdale's Twisted Tower, still the seat of power in the province, was built by Maerimydra as a beachhead for further surface expansion. Centuries of warfare in the Dalelands against Myth Drannor and, later, Cormyr eventually saw Maerimydra's removal from the surface and retreat back to the Deep Wastes.  

By the 900s DR, Llolth began losing control over the drow of the region. The arrival of Vhaeraunites from Jaezred Chaulssin - a group dedicated to freeing the drow race from the depravities of Llolth, led to the rise of the secretive faith and their power grew to rival that of the matron mothers. When the Silence of Llolth began in 1372 DR, the Vhaeraunites saw their chance and staged a coup. Led by the city's archmage and backed by an alliance of goblins, ogres, fire giants and demons, the rebels sacked the city and scattered most of its inhabitants into the surrounding deep wastes. The plan to restructure the city, however, failed.  The faithful servants of the drow goddess of the undead, Kiaransalee, led by the High Priestess Irae T'sarran prevailed in a surprise attack during the chaos. Wielding Kiaransalee's own Claw of the Revenancer, Irae and her necromancers plan to spread death throughout the underdark and silence Llolth forever."  
#summary "Maerimydra is an undead nation, dominated by Irae and her growing legions of the undead. Your priestesses are reanimators and you have access to Silveraith Mages, a powerful form of wraith that has retained its memories and its magic. The Claw also provides the ability to create Silveraith troops, sacred undead unharmed by mundane weapons and capable of raising those they kill as zombies. Unique items and spells round the nation out. "
